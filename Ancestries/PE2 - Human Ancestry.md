# PE2 - Human Ancestry

## Descriptions

### Personality Traits
- World's predominant ancestry.
- Empires and nations are vast.
- Diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly.
- Many venture forth to explor.
- Playing a Human, you might:
	- Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.
	- Seek to understand your purpose in the world.
	- Cherish your relationships with family and friends.
- Playing a Human, others probably:
	- Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and --in most cases-- your open-mindedness.
	- Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.
	- Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.

### Physical Traits
- Varied as the world's climates.
- Generally skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.
- Reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later.
- Typical human can live to be around 90 years old.
- Often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giiving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents.

### Societal Traits
- Variety also manifests in terms of governments, attitudes, and social norms.
- Oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past.
- Compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.

### Alignment and Religion
- Most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good.
- Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others biuld sprawling cities.
- Most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment.
- Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.

### Names
- Humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names.

### Ethnicities
- Variety of human ethnic groups -- many of which have origins on distant lands -- populates the continents.

## Half-Elves
- Half-elf is born to an elf and a human, or to two half-elves.
- Life can be difficult, often marked by a struggle to fit in.
- Populations of half-elves aren't particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate human and elven traditions.
- Often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded humands.
- Lack the almost alien eyes of their elf parents, though they do have a natural presence -- and often a striking beauty -- that leads many to become artists or entertainers.
- Many have difficulty forming lasting bonds with either humans or elves due to the distance they feel from both people as a whole.

### Playing a Half-Elf
- You Might:
	- Keep to yourself and find it difficult to form close bonds with others.
	- Strongly embrace or reject one side or the other of your parentage.
	- Identify strongly with and relate to other people with mixed ancestries.
- Others Probably:
	- Find you more attractive than humans and more approachable than elves.
	- Dismiss your human ethnicity and culture in light of your elven heritage.
	- Downplay the challenges of being caught between two cultures.

## Half-Orcs
- Half-orc is born to human and an orc, or two half-orcs.
- Some intolerant people see orcs more akin to monsters than people, and will fear or hate half-orcs due to lineage.
- Some only find work in manual labor or as mercenaries, others fall to crime or cruelty.
- Some find home among orc kin, or go to wilderness to live apart from society's judgement.
- Humans assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely find acceptance among societies with many such folk.
- To an orc tribe, half-orc is smart enough to make a good war leader but is weaker physically than other orcs.
	- Half-orc then has low status among orc tribe unless they can prove their strength

### Playing a Half-Orc
- You Might:
	- Ignore, embrace, or actively counter the common stereotypes about half-orcs.
	- Make the most of your size and strength, either physically or socially.
	- Keep your distance from people of most other ancestries, in case they unfairly reject you due to your orc ancestors.
- Others Probably:
	- Assume you enjoy and excel at fighting, but aren't inclined toward magical or intellectual pursuits.
	- Pity you for the tragic circumstances they assume were involved in your birth.
	- Get out of your way and back down rather than face your anger.

## Human Heritages
Unlike other ancestries, humans don't have significant physiological differences defined by their lineage. Instead, their heritages either reveal their potential as a people or reflect lineages from multiple ancesteries.

### Half-Elf
Either one of your parents was an elf, or one or both were half-elves. You have pointed ears and other telltale signs of elf heritage. You gain the elf trait, the half-elf trait, and low-light vision. In addition, you can select elf, half-elf, and human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

### Half-Orc
One of your parents was an orc, or one or both were half-orcs. You have a green tinge to your skin and other indicators of orc heritage. You gain the orc trait, the half-orc trait, and low-light vision. In addition, you can select orc, half-orc, and human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

### Skilled Heritage
Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of skills. You become trained in one skill of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in the chosen skill.

### Versatile Heritage
Humanity's versatility and ambition have fueled its ascendance to be the most common ancestry in most nations throughout the world. Select a general feat of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites (as with your ancestry feat, you can select this general feat at any point during character creation.)
