# PE2 - Elf Ancestry

## Descriptions

### Personality Traits
- Elves combine otherworldy grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries.
- Often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient.
- Value kindness and beauty.
- Strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.
- Often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups.
- Slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk.
- Elves who spend their lives among shorter-lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.
- Playing an Elf, you might:
	- Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans. Either keeping a careful emotional distance or resigning yourself to outliving them.
	- Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.
	- Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.
- Playing an Elf, others probably:
	- Focus on your apperance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.
	- Assume you practice archery, cast spells, fight demons, and have perfected one or more fine arts.
	- Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.

### Physical Traits
- Generally taller than humans.
- Possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears.
- Eyes are wide and almond-shaped, feature large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.
- Gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings.
- Reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century.
- A typical elf can live to arround 600 years old.

### Societal Traits
- Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline.
- Society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity.
	- Since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task.
- Inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherrent sense of wonder and knowledge.
- Architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.
- Hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits them best.
- Bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call *ilduliel*.
	- These relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.

### Alignment and Religion
- Often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts.
- Many are chaotic good.
- Prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic.
	- Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry.
	- Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.

### Names
- An elf keps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people.
	- Nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim.
- A single elf may be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions.
- Names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically -- at least in the Elven tongue.
- Names commonly end in "-el" or "-ara".
	- Other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables to avoid sounding too elven.
- Samples:
	- Aerel
	- Amrunelara
	- Caladrel
	- Dardlara
	- Faunra
	- Heldalel
	- Jathal
	- Lanliss
	- Oparal
	- Seldlon
	- Soumral
	- Talathel
	- Tessara
	- Variel
	- Yalandlara
	- Zordlon

## Elf Heritages

Elves live long lives and adapt to their environment after dwelling there for a long time.

### Arctic Elf
You dwell deep in the frozen north and have gained incredible resilience against cold environments, granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on)

### Cavern Elf
You were born or spent many years in underground tunnels or caverns where light is scarce. You gain darkvision.

### Seer Elf
You have an inborn ability to detect and understand magical phenomena. You can cast the *detect magic* cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to alf your level rounded up.

In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Identify Magic and to Decipher Writing of a magical nature. These skill actions typically use the Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion skill.

### Whisper Elf
Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest whispers of sound. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures in a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.

### Woodland Elf
You're adapted to life in the forest or the deep jungle, and you know how to climb trees and use foliae to your advantage. When Climbing trees, vines, and other foliage, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed.

You can always use the Take Cover action when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.
