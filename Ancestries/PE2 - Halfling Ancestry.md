# PE2 - Halfling Ancestry

## Descriptions

### Personality Traits
- Optimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by powerful wanderlust.
- Carry strong ties to house and home, often spending above their means to achieve comfort in their homelife.
- Playing a Halfling, you might:
	- Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.
	- Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiousity, even when you know it's going to lead to trouble.
	- Hold a deep and personal hatred of the practice of slavery and devote yourself to freeing those who still labor against their will.
- Playing a Halfing, others probably:
	- Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation.
	- Think you bring good luck with you.
	- Underestimate your strength, endurance, and fighting prowess.

### Physical Traits
- Short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans.
- Rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height.
- Proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads, and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.
- Prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time.
- Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet.
- Skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak.
- Hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.
- Read physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.

### Societal Traits
- Don't usually tend to congregate.
- No cultural homeland, instead weave themselves throughout the societies of the world.
- Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs.
- Some reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame.
	- These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.
- Seamlessly blend themselves into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfing twists.

### Alignment and Religion
- Loyal to their friends and their family, but aren't afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive.
- Alignments vary, typically closely in keeping with the alignment of the other ancestries that live around them.
- Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber.
- Many appreciate Cayden Cailean's role as a liberator.
- May follow religions common among other ancestries around them.

### Names
- Usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants.
- Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance.
	- This goes only for their own people, however -- halflings have names that suit them, and understnad that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics.
- Humans in particular have the tendency to refer to halflings by nicknames, with "Lucky" being common to the point of absurdity.

## Halfling Heritages
Living across the land, halflings of different heritages might appear in regions far from where their ancestores lived.

### Gutsy Halfling
Your family line is known for keeping a level head and staving off fear when the chips were down, making them wise leaders and sometimes even heroes. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.

### Hillock Halfling
Accustomed to a calm life in the hills, your people find rest and relaxation especially replenishing, particularly when indulging in creature comforts. When you regain Hit Points overnight, add your level to the Hit Points regained. When anyone uses the Medicine skill to Treat your Wounds, you can eat a snack to add your level to the Hit Points you regain from their treatment.

### Nomadic Halfling
Your ancestors have traveled from place to place for generations, never content to settle down. You gain two additional languages of your choice, chosen from among the common and uncommon languages available to you, and every time you take the Multilingual feat, you gain another new language.

### Twilight Halfling
Your ancestors performed many secret acts under the concealing cover of dusk, whether for good or ill, and over time they developed the ability to see in twilight beyond even the usual keen sight of halflings. You gain low-light vision.

### Wildwood Halfling
You hail from deep in a jungle or forest, and you've learned how to use your small size to wriggle through undergrowth, vines, and other obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain from trees, foliage, and undergrowth.
