# PE2 - Goblin Ancestry

## Descriptions

### Personality Traits
- Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs.
- Some goblens are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.
- Playing a Goblin, you might:
	- Strive to prove that you have a place among civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.
	- Fight tooth and nail -- sometimes literally - to protect yourself and your friends from danger.
	- Lighten the heavy emotional burdens other carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.
- Playing a Goblin, others probably:
	- Work to ensure you don't accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.
	- Assume you can't -- or won't -- read.
	- Wonder how you survive given your ancestry's typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.

### Physial Traits
- Stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes.
- Skin ranges from green to gray to blue.
- Often bear scars, boils, and rashes.
- Average 3 feet tall.
- Most are bald, with little or no body hair.
- Jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly.
- Fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently.
- Mutations are more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.
- Reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later.
- Goblins can live 40 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves few live past 20 years of age.

### Society
- Tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes.
	- Rarely number more than a hundred.
	- Larger the tribe is, more diligent the leader must be to keep order -- a notoriously difficult task.
- Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.
- Goblins bond closely with their allies, firecly protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear.
- Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, usually referred to colloquially as "longshanks", won't treat them kindly.
	- Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin.

### Alignment and Religion
- Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, they're rarely lawful.
- Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good.
- Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities.
	- Choose powerful monsters, natral wonders, or anything else they find fascinating.
	- Anything can be a god if you want it to.
- Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs.
- Many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.

### Names
- Goblins keep their names simple.
- Should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say.
- Namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier.
- Children often name themselves once they're old enough to do something resembling talking.

## Goblin Heritages
Goblins, especially those of different tribes, have all sorts of physiological differences, which they often discover only through hazardous "experiments."

### Charhide Goblin
Your ancestors have always had a connection to fire and a thicker skin, which allows you to resist burning. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You can also recover from being on fire more easily. Your flat check to remove persistent fire damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 if another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help.

### Irongut Goblin
You can subsist on food that most folks would consider spoiled. You can keep yourself fed with poor meals in a settlement as long as garbage is readily available, without using the Subsist downtime activity. You can eat and drink things when you are sickened.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against afflictions, against gaining the sickened condition, and to remove the sickened condition. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save affected by this bonus, you get a critical success instead. All these benefits apply only when the afflication or condition resulted from something you ingested.

### Razortooth Goblin
Your family's teeth are formidable weapons. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling group and have the finesse and unarmed traits.

### Snow Goblin
You are acclimated to living in frigid lands nad have skin ranging from sky blue to navy in color, as well as blue fur. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).

### Unbreakable Goblin
You're able to bounce back from injuries easily due to an exceptionally thick skull, cartilaginous bones, or some other mixed blessing. You gain 10 Hit Poiunts from your ancestry instead of 6. When you fall, reduce the damage you take as though you had fallen half the distance.
