## Information
**During Combat Encounters...**
If you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons— typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.

**During Social Encounters...**
You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you’re wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.

**While Exploring...**
You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.

**In Downtime...**
You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.

**You Might...**
- Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity.
- Know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.
- Cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will.

**Other's Propbably...**
- Find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it.    
- Expect you to heal their wounds.    
- Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.
