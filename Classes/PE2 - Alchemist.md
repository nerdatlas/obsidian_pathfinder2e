## Information
**During Combat Encounters...**
You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. At higher levels, your mutagens warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon.

**During Social Encounters...**
You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases.

**While Exploring...**
You keep an eye out for trouble with your bombs at the ready, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious.

**In Downtime...**
You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.

**You Might...**
- Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.
- Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you’ve made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
- Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.

**Other's Propbably...**
- Think you’re some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don’t understand that you don’t cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception.
- Don’t understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
- Assume that if you haven’t caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.
