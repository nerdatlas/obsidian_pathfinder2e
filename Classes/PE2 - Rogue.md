## Information
**During Combat Encounters...**
You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You’re a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers.

**During Social Encounters...**
Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and 6 ferreting out information are second nature to you.

**While Exploring...**
You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You’re a great asset, since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers.

**In Downtime...**
You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a thieves’ guild, or even found one of your own.

**You Might...**
- Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world.
- Know where to attain illicit goods.
- Skirt or break the law because you think it’s meaningless or have your own code.

**Other's Propbably...**
- Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you.
- Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods.
- Suspect you’re motivated primarily by greed.
