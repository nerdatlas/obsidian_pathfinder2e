## Information
**During Combat Encounters...**
You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is powerful, to conserve your best spells—or when you’ve used them all up—you also rely on cantrips.

**During Social Encounters...**
Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.

**While Exploring...**
You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your adventuring group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them.

**In Downtime...**
You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.

**You Might...**
- Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual.
- View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.
- Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells.

**Other's Propbably...**
- Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust.
- Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally.
- Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise.
