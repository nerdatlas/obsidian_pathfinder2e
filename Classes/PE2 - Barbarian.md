## Information
**During Combat Encounters...**
You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses.

**During Social Encounters...**
You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can’t get the job done.

**While Exploring...**
You look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water’s surface. If something needs breaking, you’re up to the task!

**In Downtime...**
You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.

**You Might...**
- Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.
- Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.
- Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness—and punch anyone who says this conflicts with your distaste for patience and tedium.

**Other's Propbably...**
- Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight.    
- See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.
- Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.
