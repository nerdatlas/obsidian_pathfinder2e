## Statistics

### AC Bonus
A shield grants a circumstance bonus to AC, but only when the shield is raised.

### Hardness
Whenever a shield takes damage, the amount of damage it takes is reduced by this amount. This number is particularly relevant for shields because of the [[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Feats/PE2 - Shield Block ⟳|Shield Block feat]].

### HP (BT)
The column lists the shields Hit Points and Broken Threshold. Theses measure how much damage the shield can take before it's destroyed, and how much it can take before being broken and unusable. These primarily matter for the [[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Feats/PE2 - Shield Block ⟳|Shield Block]] reaction.
