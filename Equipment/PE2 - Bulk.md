# Bulk

Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading yourself with too much gear. If you have a high [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] score, you usually don't need to worry about Bulk unless you're carrying numerous substantial items.

## Bulk Limits
You can carry an amount of Bulk equal to 5 plus your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier without penalty; if you carry more, you gain the [[PE2 - Encumbered|encumbered]] condition.

You can't hold or carry more Bulk than 10 plus your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier.

## Bulk Values
Items have a number to indicate their Bulk value, or they can be light (L) or negligible (-) for the purpose of determining Bulk. 10 light items count as 1 Bulk, and you round down fractions. Items of negligible Bulk don't count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.

## Estimating an Item's Bulk
As a general rule, an item that weighs 5 to 10 pounds is 1 Bulk, an item weighing less than a few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light. 

Particularly awkward or unwieldy items might have higher Bulk values. For example, a 10-foot pole isn't heavy, but its length makes it difficult for you to move while you have one on your person, so its Bulk is 1.

## Bulk of [[PE2 - Coins and Currency|Coins]]
Coins are a popular means of exchange due to their portability, but they can still add up. A thousand coins of any denomination or combination of denominations count as 1 Bulk. It's not usually necessary to determine the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000; simply round down fractions of 1,000.

## Bulk of Creatures
| Size of Creature | Bulk |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Tiny             | 1    |
| Small            | 3    |
| Medium           | 6    |
| Large            | 12   |
| Huge             | 24   |
| Gargantuan       | 48   |

## Dragging
In some situations, you might drag an object or creature rather than carry it. If you're dragging something, treat its Bulk as half.Typically, you can drag one thing at a time, you must use both hands to do so, and you drag slowly -- roughly 50 feet per minute unless you have some means to speed it up.
