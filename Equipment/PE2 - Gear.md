## Adventuring Gear
These items follow special rules or require more detail. 

**Adventurer’s Pack**: This item is the starter kit for an adventurer, containing the essential items for exploration and survival. The Bulk value is for the entire pack together, but see the descriptions of individual items as necessary. The pack contains the following items: a backpack, a bedroll, 10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks’ rations, soap, 5 torches, and a waterskin. 

**Alchemist’s Lab**: You need an alchemist’s lab to Craft alchemical items during downtime. An expanded alchemist’s lab gives a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks to create alchemical items.  

**Alchemist’s Tools**: This mobile collection of vials and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks. If you wear your alchemist’s tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

**Artisan’s Tools**: You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the Craft skill. Sterling artisan’s tools give you a +1 item bonus to the check. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, blacksmith’s tools differ from woodworker’s tools. If you wear your artisan’s tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

**Backpack**: A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items. and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

**Basic Crafter’s Book**: This book contains the formulas (page 293) for Crafting the common items in this chapter. 

**Caltrops**: These four‐pronged metal spikes can damage a creature’s feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature that moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a –5‐foot penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding. Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough are ruined that other creatures moving into the square are safe. Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough are ruined that they can’t be salvaged.  

**Candle**: A lit candle sheds dim light in a 10‐foot radius for 8 hours.  

**Chest**: A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk of items. 

**Climbing Kit**: This satchel includes 50 feet of rope, pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook, and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to attach yourself to the wall you’re Climbing, moving half as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit. A single kit has only enough materials for one climber; each climber needs their own kit. If you wear your climbing kit, you can access it as part of a Climb action.

**Clothing**: Ordinary clothing is functional with basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk’s robes, or work clothes.

Explorer’s clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn’t a suit of armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common sorts look like clerical vestments, monk’s garments, or wizard’s robes, as members of all three classes are likely to avoid wearing armor. For more information on explorer’s clothing, see pages 275–276.
