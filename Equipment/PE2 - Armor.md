## Armor Class
Armor Class = 10 + [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier (up to your armor's Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor's item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties

## Donning and Removing Armor
Light armor - 1 minute to don
Medium or Heavy armor - 5 minutes to don
All armor - 1 minute to remove

## Category
Indicates which proficiency bonus you use while wearing the armor.
- Unarmored
- Light Armor
- Medium Armor
- Heavy Armor

## AC Bonus
Bonus you add for the armor when determining Armor Class.

## [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]] Modifier Cap (Dex Cap)
The maximum amount of your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier that can apply to your AC while you are wearing a given suit of armor.

## Check Penalty
While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] and [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]]-based skill checks, except for those that have the attack trait.

## Speed Penalty
While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed to your Speed, as well as other movement types you have, such as climb Speed or swim Speed. Minimum Speed is 5 feet. If you meet the [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] score reduce this penalty by 5 feet.

## [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]]
Indicates the [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] score at which you are strong enough to overcome some of the armor's penalties.

If [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] score is greater than or equal to this value, you no longer take the armor's check penalty, and decrease the Speed penalty by 5 feet.

## [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]]
Armor's [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]], asuminmg you're wearing the armor and distributing its weight across your body. A suit of armor that's carried usually has 1 more [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]] than what's listed.

## Group
Each type of clothing and armor belongs to a group, which classifies it with similar types of armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, typically to grant armor specialization effects.

## Armor Traits
The traits for each suit of armor appear in this entry. Armor can have the following traits:
- **Bulwark**: The armor covers you so completely that it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a *fireball*, you add a +3 modifier instead of your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity Modifier]].
- **Comfort**: The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.
- **Flexible**: The armor is flexible enough that it doesn't hinder most actions. You don't apply its check penalty to [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] or [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] chcks.
- **Noisy**: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor's check penalty applies to [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]] checks even if you meet the required [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] score.

## Armor Specialization Effects
- **Chain**: The armor is so flexible it can bend with a critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits by either 4 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.
- **Composite**: The numerous overlapping pieces of this armor protect you from piercing attacks. You gain resistance to piercing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
- **Leather**: The thick second skin of the armor disperses blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
- **Plate**: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.

## Damaging Armor
Your armor's statistics are based on the material it's predominantly made from. It's not likely your armor will take damage.
