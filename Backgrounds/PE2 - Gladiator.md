# PE2 - Gladiator
The bloody games of the arena taught you the art of combat. Before you attained true fame, you departed -- or escaped -- the arena to explore the world. Your skill at drawing both blood and a crowd's attention pay off in a new adventuring life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Performance skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the Impressive Performance skill feat.
