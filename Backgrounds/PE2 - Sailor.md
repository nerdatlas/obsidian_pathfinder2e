# PE2 - Sailor
You heard the call of the sea from a young age. Perhaps you signed onto a merchant's vessel, joined the navy, or even fell in with a crew of pirates and scalawags.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the Underwater Marauder skill feat.
