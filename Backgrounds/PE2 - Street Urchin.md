# PE2 - Street Urchin
You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next meal. While some folk adventure for the glory, you do so to survive.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Thievery and a Lore skill for the city you lived in as a street urchin (such as Absalom Lore or Magnimar Lore). You gain the Pickpocket skill feat.
