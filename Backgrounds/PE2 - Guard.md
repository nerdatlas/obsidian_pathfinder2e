# PE2 - Guard
You served in the guard, out of either patriotism or the need for coin. Either way, you know how to get a difficult suspect to talk. However, you left the guard, you might think of adventuring as a way to use your skills on a wider stage.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Legal Lore or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Quick Coercion skill feat.
