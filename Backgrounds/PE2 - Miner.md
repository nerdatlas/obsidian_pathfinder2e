# PE2 - Miner
You earned a living wrenching precious minerals from the lightless depths of the earth. Adventuring might have seemed lucrative or glamorous compared to this backbreaking labor -- and if you have to head back underground, this time you plan to do so armed with a real weapon instead of a miner's pick.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Mining Lore skill. You gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat with underground terrain.
