# Rage ◆
#PE2Barbarian #PE2Concentrate #PE2Emotion #PE2Mental 
**Requirements** You aren't fatigued or raging.

-----
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Constitution|Constitution]] modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You can’t voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging: 
- You deal 2 additional damage on melee Strikes. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
- You take a –1 penalty to AC.  
- You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging. 
After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can’t Rage again for 1 minute.
