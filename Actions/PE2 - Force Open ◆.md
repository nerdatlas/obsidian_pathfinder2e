# Force Open â—†
#PE2Attack
Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate. With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls. Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a -2 item penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open.

**Critical Success** You open the door, window, container, or gate and avoid damaging it in the process.
**Success** You break the door, window, container, or gate open, and it gains the broken condition. If it's especially sturdy, the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
**Critical Failure** Your attempt jams the door, window, container, or gate shut, imposing a -2 circumstance penalty on future attempts to Force it Open.

## Sample Force Open Tasks
**Untrained** fabric, flimsy glass
**Trained** ice, sturdy glass
**Expert** flimsy wooden door, wooden portcullis
**Master** sturdy wooden door, iron portcullis, metal bar
**Legendary** stone or iron door
