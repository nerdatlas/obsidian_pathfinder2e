# Quick Alchemy ◆
#PE2Alchemist #PE2Manipulate 
**Cost** 1 batch of infused reagents
**Requirements** You have the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and you're either holding or wearing alchemist's tools.

-----
You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment’s notice. You create a single alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that’s in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]] check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.
