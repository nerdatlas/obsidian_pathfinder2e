**Requirements** You have both hands free.

You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it's particularly easy, you must attempt an Athletics check. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances. You're flat-footed unless you have a climb Speed.

**Critical Success** You move up, across, or safely down the incline for 5 feet plus 5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 10 feet for most PCs).
**Success** You move up, across, or safely down the incline for 5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 5 feet for most PCs, minimum 5 feet if your Speed is below 20 feet).
**Critical Failure** You fall. If you began the climb on stable ground, you fall and land prone.

**Untrained** ladder, steep slope, low-branched tree
**Trained** rigging, rope, typical tree

**Master** ceiling with handholds and footholds, rock wall
