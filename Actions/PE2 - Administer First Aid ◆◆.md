# Administer First Aid ◆◆
#PE2Manipulate 
**Requirements** You're wearing or holding healer's tools.

-----
You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is dying or bleeding. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which ailment you're trying to treat before you roll. You can Administer First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.
- **Stabilize** Attempt a [[PE2 - Medicine]] check on a creature that has 0 Hit Points and the dying condition. The DC is equal to 5 + that creature's recovery roll DC.
- **Stop Bleeding** Attempt a [[PE2 - Medicine]] check on a creature that is taking persistent bleed damage, giving them a chance to make another flat check to remove the persistent damage. The DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.

**Success** If you're trying to stabalize, the creature loses the dying condition (but remains unconscious). If you're trying to stop bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.
**Critical Failure** If you were trying to stabalize, the creature's dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, it immediately takes an ammount of damage equal to its persistent bleed damage.
