# Make an Impression
#PE2Auditory #PE2Concentrate #PE2Exploration #PE2Linguistic #PE2Mental 
With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt a [[PE2 - Diplomacy]] check against the Will DC of one target, modified by any circumstances the GM sees fit. Good impressions (or bad impressions, on a critical failure) last for only the current social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.

**Critical Success** The target's attitude toward you improves by two steps.
**Success** The target's attitude toward you improves by one step.
**Critical Failure** The target's attitude toward you decreases by one step.
