# Conceal An Object â—†
#PE2Manipulate  #PE2Secret 
You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your [[PE2 - Stealth]] check and compares it to this passive observer's Perception DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your [[PE2 - Stealth]] DC (finding the object on a success).

You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check results to your [[PE2 - Stealth]] DC to determine whether they find the object.

**Success** The object remains undetected.
**Failure** The searcher finds the object.
