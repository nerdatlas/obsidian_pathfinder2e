# Disable a Device ◆◆
#PE2Manipulate 
**Requirements** Some devices require you to use thieves' tools when disabling them.

----
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Thieves' tools ar ehelpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in [[PE2 - Thievery]] to disable it.

Your [[PE2 - Thievery]] check result determines how much progress you make.

**Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achive two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.
**Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device.
**Critical Failure** You trigger the device.
