# Maneuver In Flight â—†
#PE2Move 
**Requirements** You have a fly Speed.

---
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Acrobatics check. The GM determins what maneuvers are possible, but they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

**Success** You succeed at the maneuver
**Failure** Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply can't move or if some other detrimental effect happens. The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you attempted.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the consequence is more dire.

## Sample Maneuver in Flight Tasks
**Trained** steep ascent or descent
**Expert** Fly against the wind, hover midair
**Master** reverse direction
**Legendary** fly through gale force winds
