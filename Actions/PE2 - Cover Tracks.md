# Cover Tracks
#PE2Concentrate #PE2Exploration #PE2Move 
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed. You don't need to attempt a [[PE2 - Survival]] check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a [[PE2 - Survival]] against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.

In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.
