# Dreaming Potential
## Spell 5
#PE2Enchantment #PE2Mental 
**Traditions** occult
**Cast** 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 willing sleeping creature
**Duration** 8 hours

-----
You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore the endless possibilities of its own potential within the ever- changing backdrop of its dreamscape. If it sleeps the full 8 hours uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent a day of downtime retraining, though it can’t use *dreaming potential* for any retraining that would require either an instructor or specialized knowledge it can’t access within the dream.
