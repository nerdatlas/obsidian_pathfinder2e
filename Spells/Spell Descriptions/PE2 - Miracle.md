# Miracle
## Spell 10
#PE2Divination 
**Traditions** divine
**Cast** ◆◆◆ material, somatic, verbal

-----
You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting of *miracle* can do any of the following things.
- Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower.
- Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower.  
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the *wish* spell.  

The GM might allow you to try using *miracle* to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.
