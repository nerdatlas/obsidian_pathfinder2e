-----
A ray that saps a foe’s strength flashes from your hand. Attempt a ranged spell attack against the target. If you succeed, that creature attempts a Fortitude save to determine the spell’s effect. If your attack roll is a critical success, use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of its save. 

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
**Success** The target becomes enfeebled 1. 
**Failure** The target becomes enfeebled 2. 
**Critical Failure** The target becomes enfeebled 3.
