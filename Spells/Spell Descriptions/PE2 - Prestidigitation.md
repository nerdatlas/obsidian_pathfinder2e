The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]]. Each time you [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]], you can choose one of four options.
- **Cook** Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- **Lift** Slowly lift an unattended object of light [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]] or less 1 foot off the ground.  
- **Make** Create a temporary object of negligible [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]], made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can’t be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- **Tidy** Color, clean, or soil an object of light [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]] or less. You can affect an object of 1 [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]] with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]].

*Prestidigitation* can’t deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]].
