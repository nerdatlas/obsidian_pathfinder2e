-----
You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off-putting. The target must attempt a Will save. 

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]], [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]], [[PE2 - Intimidation|Intimidation]], or [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]] check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step worse (for instance, unfriendly instead of indifferent).
**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two steps worse.
