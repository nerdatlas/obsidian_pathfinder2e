#PE2Uncommon #PE2Divination #PE2Scrying

-----
You magically spy on a creature of your choice. *Scrying* works like *[[PE2 - Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]]*, except that the image you receive is less precise, insufficient for *teleport* and similar spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven’t met the target in person, *scrying’s* DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target’s identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature’s fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.

The effect of *scrying* depends on the target’s Will save. 

**Critical Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you. 
**Success** The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.  
**Failure** The spell succeeds.  
**Critical Failure** The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.
