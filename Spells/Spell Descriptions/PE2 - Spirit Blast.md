-----
You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature’s spirit, dealing 16d6 force damage. Because *spirit blast* affects the creature’s spirit, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness (such as via *[[PE2 - Project Image|project image]]*) or possessing another creature even if the target’s body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn’t harmed by the blast. The blast doesn’t harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
