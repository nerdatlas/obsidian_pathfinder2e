Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4 status bonus to [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]] checks to [[PE2 - Lie|Lie]] and against Perception checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add your level even if you’re untrained. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty or increase by half.
