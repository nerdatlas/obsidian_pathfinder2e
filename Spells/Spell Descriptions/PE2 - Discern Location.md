# Discern Location
## Spell 8
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Detection #PE2Divination 
**Traditions** arcane, divine, occult
**Cast** 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
**Range** unlimited; **Targets** 1 creature or object

-----
You learn the name of the target’s exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.

You can target a creature only if you’ve seen it in person, have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment of it. *Discern location* automatically overcomes protections against detection and divination of lower level than this spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.
