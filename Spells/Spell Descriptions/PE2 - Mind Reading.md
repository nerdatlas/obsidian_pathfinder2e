With a cursory mental touch, you attempt to read the target’s mind. It must attempt a Will save. The target then becomes temporarily immune to your mind reading for 1 hour.  

**Critical Success** The target perceives vague surface thoughts from you when you Cast the Spell.  
**Success** You find out whether the target’s [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.  
**Failure** You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target when you Cast the Spell, and you find out whether its [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, and for the duration of the spell, you can [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]] to detect the target’s surface thoughts again. The target doesn’t receive any additional saves.
