# Summon Celestial
## Spell 5
#PE2Conjuration 
**Traditions** divine
**Cast** ◆◆◆ material, somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet
**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

-----
You conjure a celestial to fight on your behalf. This works like *[[PE2 - Summon Animal|summon animal]]*, except you summon a common creature that has the celestial trait and whose level is 5 or lower. You can’t summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity’s preferred alignments (or, if you don’t have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM’s discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of celestials, even if their alignments match.

**Heightened** As *[[PE2 - Summon Animal|summon animal]]*.
