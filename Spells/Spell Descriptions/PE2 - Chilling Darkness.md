**Traditions** divine

-----
You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. You deal 5d6 cold damage, plus 5d6 evil damage if the target is a celestial.

If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, *chilling darkness* attempts to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell’s target.  

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.  
**Success** The target takes full damage.  

---
**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the evil damage against celestials increases by 2d6.
