# Dominate
## Spell 6
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Enchantment #PE2Incapacitation #PE2Mental 
**Traditions** arcane, occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations

-----
You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn’t act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is stunned 1 as it fights off your commands. 
**Failure** You control the target. It gains the controlled condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.  
**Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.  

---
**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited.
