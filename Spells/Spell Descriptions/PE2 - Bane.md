#PE2Enchantment #PE2Mental 
**Traditions** divine, occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Area** 5-foot emanation
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 minute

-----
You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt. Enemies in the area must succeed at a Will save or take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls as long as they are in the area. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast bane, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet and force enemies in the area that weren’t yet affected to attempt another saving throw. *Bane* can counteract *bless*.
