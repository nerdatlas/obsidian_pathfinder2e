-----
You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air in a geometric cloud. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it enters the pattern, when it ends its turn within the pattern, or if it uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently fascinated by the pattern doesn’t attempt new saves. 

**Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Failure** The target is fascinated by the pattern.  
**Critical Failure** The target is fascinated by the pattern. While it remains fascinated, it can’t use reactions.
