# Cloak of Colors
## Spell 5
#PE2Illusion #PE2Visual 
**Traditions** arcane, occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are dazzled while adjacent to it, and attacking the target causes a brilliant flash of light. A creature that hits the target with a melee attack must attempt a Will save.  

**Success** The attacker is unaffected.  
**Failure** The attacker is blinded for 1 round.  
**Critical Failure** The attacker is stunned for 1 round.  
The creature is temporarily immune until the end of its turn; this effect has the incapacitation trait.
