When the spell ends, the target doesn’t necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.

**Success** The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies the spell (see Identifying Spells on page 305).
