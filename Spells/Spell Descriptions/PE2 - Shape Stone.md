# Shape Stone
## Spell 4
#PE2Earth #PE2Transmutation 
**Traditions** arcane, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** touch; **Targets** cube of stone 10 feet across or smaller

-----
You shape the stone into a rough shape of your choice. The shaping process is too crude to produce intricate parts, fine details, moving pieces, or the like. Any creatures standing atop the stone when you reshape it must each attempt a Reflex save or [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check.  

**Success** The creature is unaffected.  
**Failure** The creature falls prone atop the stone.  
**Critical Failure** The creature falls off the stone (if applicable) and lands prone.
