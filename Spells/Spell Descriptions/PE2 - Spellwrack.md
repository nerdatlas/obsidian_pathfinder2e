# Spellwrack
## Spell 6
#PE2Abjuration #PE2Curse #PE2Force 
**Traditions** arcane, divine, occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Will

-----
You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save. 

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from *spellwrack*, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful [[PE2 - Arcana|Arcana]] check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute. 
**Failure** As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12.
