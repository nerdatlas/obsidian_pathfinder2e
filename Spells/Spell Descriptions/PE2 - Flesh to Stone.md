# Flesh to Stone
## Spell 6
#PE2Transmutation 
**Traditions** arcane, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 120 feet; **Targets** 1 creature made of flesh
**Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Duration** varies

-----
You try to turn the target’s flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.  

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically petrified. The spell ends if the creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.
