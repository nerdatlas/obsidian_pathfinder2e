You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic. *Nondetection* attempts to counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the target or the target’s gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a divination that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects only for *nondetection’s* target.
