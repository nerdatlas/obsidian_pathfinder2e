#PE2Divination 
**Traditions** primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Duration** 10 minutes

You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] skill with animals. The spell doesn’t make them more friendly than normal. Cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
