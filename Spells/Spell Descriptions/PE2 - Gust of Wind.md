# Gust of Wind
## Spell 1
#PE2Air #PE2Evocation 
**Traditions** arcane, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Area** 60-foot line
**Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Duration** until the start of your next turn

-----
A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the point where you are when you cast the spell to the line’s opposite end. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light [[PE2 - Bulk|Bulk]] or less around, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into the gust must attempt the save on entering. 

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature can’t move against the wind.  
**Failure** The creature is knocked prone. If it was flying, it suffers the effects of critical failure instead.  
**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet in the wind’s direction, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
