# Nature Incarnate
## Spell 10
#PE2Polymorph #PE2Transmutation 
**Traditions** primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
The primal power of the world flows through you. You transform into an incarnation of nature, either a green man or a kaiju. Your battle form is Medium for a green man or Gargantuan (30-foot-by-30-foot space) for a kaiju. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. While in this form, you gain the plant trait (for a green man) or the beast trait (for a kaiju). You can [[PE2 - Dismiss ◆|Dismiss]] the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:
- AC = 25 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 30 temporary Hit Points.
- Darkvision.
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +34, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] modifier of +36, unless your own modifier is higher. 

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of incarnation you choose:    
- **Green Man** Speed 40 feet, climb Speed 40 feet; **Melee** ◆ vines (reach 30 feet, versatile P), **Damage** 6d8+12 bludgeoning; **Ranged** ◆ thorns (range 100 feet), **Damage** 6d6+6 piercing; **Green Caress** (aura, primal, transmutation) 60 feet. Enemies other than plants must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or become clumsy 1 for 1 round (clumsy 2 on a critical failure).
- **Kaiju** Speed 50 feet; resistance 5 to physical damage; **Melee** ◆ jaws (reach 30 feet), **Damage** 6d10+10 piercing; **Melee** ◆ claws (agile, reach 30 feet), **Damage** 6d8+8 slashing; **Melee** ◆ foot (agile, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 6d6+10 bludgeoning; **Unstoppable** You are immune to being immobilized and ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; **Trample** ◆◆◆ You move up to double your Speed and move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures, trampling each creature whose space you enter. A trampled creature takes foot damage with a basic Reflex save against your spell DC.
