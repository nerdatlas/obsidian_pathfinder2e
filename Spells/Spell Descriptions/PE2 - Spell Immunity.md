-----
You ward a creature against the effects of a single spell. Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the verbal component. *Spell immunity* attempts to counteract that spell whenever *spell immunity’s* target is the target of the named spell or in that spell’s area. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets an area or multiple targets with *spell immunity* negates the effects only for the target affected by *spell immunity*.
