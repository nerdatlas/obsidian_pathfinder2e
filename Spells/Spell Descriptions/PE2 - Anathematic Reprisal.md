# Anathematic Reprisal
## Spell 4
#PE2Enchantment #PE2Mental 
**Traditions** divine
**Cast** ⟳ somatic, verbal; **Trigger** A creature performs an act anathema to your deity.
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** the triggering creature
**Saving Throw** Will

-----
You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity’s anathema committed.

You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing.

You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also stupefied 1 for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
