# Insect Form
## Spell 3
#PE2Polymorph #PE2Transmutation 
**Traditions** primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal battle form. When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle, centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can [[PE2 - Dismiss ◆|Dismiss]] this spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:
- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 10 temporary Hit Points.
- Low-light vision. 
- One or more attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.  

You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
- **Ant** Speed 30 feet, climb Speed 30 feet; **Melee** ◆ mandibles, **Damage** 2d6 bludgeoning.
- **Beetle** Speed 25 feet; **Melee** ◆ mandibles, **Damage** 2d10 bludgeoning.
