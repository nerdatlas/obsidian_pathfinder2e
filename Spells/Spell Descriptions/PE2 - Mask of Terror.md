# Mask of Terror
## Spell 7
#PE2Emotion #PE2Fear #PE2Illusion #PE2Mental #PE2Visual 
**Traditions** arcane, occult, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.

When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.  

**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature becomes frightened 2 before using its action.
**Critical Failure** The creature becomes frightened 2, and its action fails and is wasted.

---
**Heightened (8th)** You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.
