#PE2Earth #PE2Evocation
**Traditions** arcane, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 500 feet; **Area** 60-foot burst
**Duration** 1 round

-----
You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures.

The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand.
- **Shaking Ground** The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.
- **Fissures** Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful DC 15 Athletics checks to Climb.
- **Collapse** Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex save to avoid it.

**Critical Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage. **Success** The creature takes half the collapse damage and falls prone.  
**Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls prone.  
**Critical Failure** The creature takes the full collapse damage and falls into a fissure.
