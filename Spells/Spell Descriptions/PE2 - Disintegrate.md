# Disintegrate
## Spell 6
#PE2Attack #PE2Evocation 
**Traditions** arcane
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 120 feet; **Targets** 1 creature or unattended object
**Saving Throw** Fortitude

-----
You fire a green ray at your target. Make a spell attack. You deal 12d10 damage, and the target must attempt a basic Fortitude save. On a critical hit, treat the save result as one degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder; its gear remains.

An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of Hardness, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. This automatically destroys any force construct, such as a *wall of force*.

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d10.
