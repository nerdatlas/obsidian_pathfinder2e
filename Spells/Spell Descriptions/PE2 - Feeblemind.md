-----
You drastically reduce the target’s mental faculties. The target must attempt a Will save. The effects of this curse can be removed only through *remove curse* or another effect that targets curses. 

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is stupefied 2 for 1 round.  
**Failure** The target is stupefied 4 with an unlimited duration. **Critical Failure** The target’s intellect is permanently reduced below that of an animal, and it treats its [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Charisma|Charisma]], [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]], and [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Wisdom|Wisdom]] modifiers as –5. It loses all class abilities that require mental faculties, including all spellcasting. If the target is a PC, they become an NPC under the GM’s control.
