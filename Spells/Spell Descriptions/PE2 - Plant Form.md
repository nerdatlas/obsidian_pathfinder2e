# Plant Form
## Spell 5
#PE2Plant #PE2Polymorph #PE2Transmutation 
**Traditions** primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal

-----
Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into a Large plant battle form. You must have space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose arboreal, flytrap, or shambler. You can substitute a similar specific plant to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but this has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the plant trait. You can [[PE2 - Dismiss ◆|Dismiss]] the spell. 

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless which battle form you choose:
- AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 12 temporary Hit Points.
- Resistance 10 to poison.
- Low-light vision.
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These attacks are [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] modifier of +19, unless your own modifier is higher. 

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant you choose:
- **Arboreal** Speed 30 feet; **Melee** ◆ branch (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d10 bludgeoning; **Melee** ◆ foot, **Damage** 2d8 bludgeoning; you can speak in this form, but you still can’t Cast a Spell or supply verbal components.
- **Flytrap** Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; **Melee** ◆ leaf (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d8 piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
- **Shambler** Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 20 feet; resistance 10 to electricity; **Melee** ◆ vine (reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d8 slashing.

**Heightened (6th)** Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus +16, and [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] +22.
