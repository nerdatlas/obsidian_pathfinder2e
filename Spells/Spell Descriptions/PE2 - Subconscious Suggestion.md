-----
You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target’s  
mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs (as  
described on page 305). You suggest a course of action to the  
target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem  
like a logical course of action to the target, and it can’t be self-  
destructive or obviously against the target’s self-interest. The  
target must attempt a Will save. 

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.  
**Success** The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.  
**Failure** The suggestion remains in the target’s subconscious until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
