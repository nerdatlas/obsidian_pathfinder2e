# Possession
## Spell 7
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Incapacitation #PE2Mental #PE2Necromancy #PE2Possession
**Traditions** occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 living creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 minute

-----
You send your mind and soul into the target’s body, attempting to take control. The target must attempt a Will save. You can choose to use the effects of a degree of success more favorable to the target if you prefer.

While you’re possessing a target, your own body is unconscious and can’t wake up normally. You can sense everything the possessed target does. You can [[PE2 - Dismiss ◆|Dismiss]] this spell. If the possessed body dies, the spell ends and you must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or be paralyzed for 1 hour, or 24 hours on a critical failure. If the spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the possessed creature’s initiative count.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** You possess the target but can’t control it. You ride along in the body while the spell lasts.  
**Failure** You possess the target and take partial control of it. You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might control the target. At the start of each of the target’s turns, it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it’s controlled by you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.
**Critical Failure** You possess the target fully, and it can only watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is controlled by you.

---
**Heightened (9th)** The duration is 10 minutes, and you can physically enter the creature’s body, protecting your physical body while the spell lasts.
