## Spell 2
#PE2Plant #PE2Transmutation 
**Traditions** primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 120 feet; **Area** all squares in a 20-foot-radius burst that contain plants

-----
Plants in the area entangle creatures. The area counts as difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also immobilized for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to Escape at *entangle’s* DC to remove these effects.
