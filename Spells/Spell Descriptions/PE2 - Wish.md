# Wish
## Spell 10
#PE2Divination 
**Traditions** arcane
**Cast** ◆◆◆ material, somatic, verbal

-----
You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A *wish* spell can produce any one of the following effects.
- Duplicate any arcane spell of 9th level or lower.  
- Duplicate any non-arcane spell of 7th level or lower.  
- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.  
- Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell.  

The GM might allow you to try using *wish* to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.
