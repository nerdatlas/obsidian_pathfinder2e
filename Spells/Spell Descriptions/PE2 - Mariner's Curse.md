You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving sea. The target must attempt a Will save.  

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target becomes sickened 1. Reducing its sickened
condition to 0 ends the curse.  
**Failure** The target becomes sickened 1 and can’t reduce its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The curse can be lifted by remove curse or similar magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes sickened 2.
