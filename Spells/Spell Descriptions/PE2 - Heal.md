# Heal
## Spell 1
#PE2Healing #PE2Necromancy #PE2Positive 
**Traditions** divine, primal
**Cast** ◆ to ◆◆◆
**Range** varies; **Targets** 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature

-----
You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of positive damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.  

◆ **(somatic)** The spell has a range of touch.  
◆◆ **(somatic, verbal)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you’re healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.  
◆◆◆ **(material, somatic, verbal)** You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.  

---
**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
