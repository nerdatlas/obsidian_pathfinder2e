# Searing Light
## Spell 3
#PE2Attack #PE2Evocation #PE2Fire #PE2Good #PE2Light 
**Traditions** divine, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 120 feet; **Targets** 1 creature

-----
You shoot a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 good damage. 

**Critical Success** The target takes double fire damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
**Success** The target takes full damage.  

If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, *searing light* attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell’s target.  

---
**Heightened (+1)** The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.
