-----
You conjure grease, with effects based on choosing area or target.

- **Area** All solid ground in the area is covered with grease. Each creature standing on the greasy surface must succeed at a Reflex save or an [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check against your spell DC or fall prone. Creatures using an action to move onto the greasy surface during the spell’s duration must attempt either a Reflex save or an [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check to [[PE2 - Balance ◆|Balance]]. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn’t have to attempt a check or save.
- **Target** If you cast the spell on an unattended object, anyone trying to pick up the object must succeed at an [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or Reflex save against your spell DC to do so. If you target an attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt an [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check or Reflex save. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes a –2 circumstance penalty to all checks that involve using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder releases the item. The object lands in an adjacent square of the GM’s choice. If you cast this spell on a worn object, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against attempts to grapple them.
