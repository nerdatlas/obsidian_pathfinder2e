# Remove Curse
## Spell 4
#PE2Healing #PE2Necromancy 
**Traditions** divine, occult
**Cast** 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 creature

-----
Your touch grants a reprieve to a cursed creature. You attempt to counteract one curse afflicting the target. If the curse comes from a cursed item or other external source, a success indicates that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed item, but it doesnâ€™t remove the curse from the item.
