# Gentle Repose
## Spell 2
#PE2Necromancy 
**Traditions** arcane, divine, occult, primal
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 corpse
**Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations

-----
The targeted corpse doesn’t decay, nor can it be transformed into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for example, *raise dead*), do not count the duration of *gentle repose* against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.

**Heightened (5th)** The spell’s duration is unlimited, but the spell takes one more action to cast and requires a material component and a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp).
