**Traditions** arcane, occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 door, lock, or container
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
You make the target easier to open. *Knock* grants a +4 status bonus to any creature that tries to open the target door, lock, or container with an [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] or a [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]] check. You can attempt a [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]] check to open the target as part of casting knock, and you add your level even if you’re untrained.

Knock counteracts *lock*.
