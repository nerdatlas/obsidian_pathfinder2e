# Modify Memory
## Spell 4
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Divination #PE2Mental 
**Traditions** occult
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** unlimited

-----
You alter the target’s memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory’s clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.  

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.  
**Success** The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of *modify memory*, unless it identifies the spell.  
**Failure** During the first 5 minutes of the spell’s duration, you can [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]] to modify a memory once each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory.

Any memories you’ve altered remain changed as long as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is up, you can’t alter any further memories.

**Heightened (6th)** You can cast the spell on a willing target to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50 words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches these omissions with an indistinct haze.
