**Cast** â—† somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 living creature touched
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 minute

-----
You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, *[[PE2 - Harm|harm]]* spells treat the creature as undead and *[[PE2 - Heal|heal]]* spells treat the creature as living. In addition, *[[PE2 - Harm|harm]]* spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.

If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.  

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target heals half as much from *[[PE2 - Heal|heal]]* and takes half as much damage from *[[PE2 - Harm|harm]]* for 1 round.  
**Failure** Effects as described in the text.

**Heightened (+1)** The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.
