**Domain** truth

Divine insight lets you see things as they truly are. The GM attempts a secret counteract check against each illusion that is at least partially within the area. Instead of counteracting the illusion, you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against an *[[PE2 - Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]]* spell, you see the creature’s true form but *[[PE2 - Illusory Disguise|illusory disguise]]* doesn’t end).

The area moves with you for the duration of the spell, and the GM attempts a secret counteract check each time a new illusion is within the area.

**Heightened (7th)** You can allow everyone to see through illusions you succeed against, not just yourself.
