You hurl a held melee weapon with which you are trained at the target, making a spell attack roll. On a success, you deal the weapon’s damage as if you had hit with a melee Strike, but adding your spellcasting ability modifier to damage, rather than your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage, and you add the weapon’s critical specialization effect. Regardless of the outcome, the weapon flies back to you and returns to your hand.
