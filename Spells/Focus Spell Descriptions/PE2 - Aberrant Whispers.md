You utter phrases in an unknown tongue, assaulting the minds of those nearby. Each target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of its save, each target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute. You can increase the number of actions it takes to Cast the Spell (to a maximum of 3 actions total). For each additional action, increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet, to a maximum of 10 extra feet for 3 actions. 

**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The target is stupefied 2.  
**Critical Failure** The target is confused.
