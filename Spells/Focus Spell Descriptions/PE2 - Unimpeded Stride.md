Nothing can hold you in place. You immediately escape from every magical effect that has you immobilized or grabbed unless the effect is of a higher level than your *unimpeded stride* spell. You then Stride. During this movement, you ignore difficult terrain and any circumstance or status penalties to your Speed.
