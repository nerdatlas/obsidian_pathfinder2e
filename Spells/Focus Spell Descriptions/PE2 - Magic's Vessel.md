A creature becomes a receptacle for pure magical energy sent by your deity. The target gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws. Each time you Cast a Spell from your spell slots, you automatically [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain this Spell]] and grant its target resistance to damage from spells until the start of your next turn. This resistance is equal to the level of the spell you cast.
