## Focus 5
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Champion #PE2Evocation #PE2Good #PE2Litany
**Cast** ◆ verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 evil creature
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 round

-----
Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target’s ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.  

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target can’t use reactions.  
**Failure** The target can’t use reactions and is slowed 1.  
**Critical Failure** The target can’t use reactions and is slowed 2.
