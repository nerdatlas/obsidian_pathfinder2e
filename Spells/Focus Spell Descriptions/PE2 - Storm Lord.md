**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal; **Requirements** You are outdoors and aboveground
**Area** 100-foot emanation which affects you
**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

The sky above you darkens in a matter of moments, swirling with ominous clouds punctuated by flashes of lighting. The first time each round you [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]], you can select one of the following effects to occur in the area.
- **Calm** No additional effect.  
- **Fog** Heavy fog rolls in, concealing the area with the effects of *[[PE2 - Obscuring Mist|obscuring mist]]*.  
- **Rain** Torrential rain falls from the sky, dousing ordinary flames. Creatures in the area take a –2 circumstance penalty to [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] and Perception checks.  
- **Wind** Powerful winds buffet the area in all directions. Ranged attacks take a –4 circumstance penalty, and all flying is against the wind and counts as moving through difficult terrain.  

In addition, once per round you can use a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, to call down a bolt of lightning, striking any target in range that you can see. You deal 10d6 electricity damage to the target; it must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it is also deafened for 1 round.
