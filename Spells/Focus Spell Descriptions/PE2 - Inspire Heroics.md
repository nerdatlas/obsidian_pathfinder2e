You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide with your *[[PE2 - Inspire Courage|inspire courage]]* or *[[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Spells/Focus Spell Descriptions/PE2 - Inspire Defense|inspire defense]]* composition. If your next action is to cast *[[PE2 - Inspire Courage|inspire courage]]* or *[[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Spells/Focus Spell Descriptions/PE2 - Inspire Defense|inspire defense]]*, attempt a [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]] check. The DC is usually a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your *[[PE2 - Inspire Courage|inspire courage]]* or *[[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Spells/Focus Spell Descriptions/PE2 - Inspire Defense|inspire defense]]* composition depends on the result of your check.  

**Critical Success** The status bonus from your *[[PE2 - Inspire Courage|inspire courage]]* or *[[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Spells/Focus Spell Descriptions/PE2 - Inspire Defense|inspire defense]]* increases to +3.  
**Success** The status bonus from *[[PE2 - Inspire Courage|inspire courage]]* or *[[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Spells/Focus Spell Descriptions/PE2 - Inspire Defense|inspire defense]]* increases to +2.
