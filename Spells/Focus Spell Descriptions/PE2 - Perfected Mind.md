# Perfected Mind
## Focus 1
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Abjuration #PE2Cleric 
**Domain** perfection
**Cast** â—† verbal

-----
You meditate upon perfection to remove all distractions from your mind. Attempt a new Will save against one mental effect currently affecting you that required a Will save. Use the result of this new save to determine the outcome of the mental effect, unless the new save would have a worse result than the original save, in which case nothing happens. You can use *perfected mind* against a given effect only once.
