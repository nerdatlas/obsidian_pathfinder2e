**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

Leathery wings sprout from your back, giving you a fly Speed of 60 feet or your Speed, whichever is faster. When this spell’s duration would end, if you’re still flying, you float to the ground, as *[[PE2 - Feather Fall|feather fall]]*. You can increase the Focus Point cost by 1 to gain the effects of *dragon claws* as long as the wings last.

**Heightened (8th)** The duration increases to 10 minutes.
