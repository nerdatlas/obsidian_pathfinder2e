# Veil of Confidence
## Focus 1
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Cleric #PE2Enchantment #PE2Mental 
**Domain** confidence
**Cast** â—† verbal
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current frightened condition by 1, and whenever you would become frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1.

If you critically fail a save against fear, *veil of confidence* ends immediately, and you increase any frightened condition you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.
