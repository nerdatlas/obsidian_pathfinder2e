**Domain** luck
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 willing creature

You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

If you cast bit of luck again, any previous *bit of luck* you cast that’s still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with *bit of luck*, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
