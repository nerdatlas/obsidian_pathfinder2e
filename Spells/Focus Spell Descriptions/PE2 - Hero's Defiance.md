# Hero's Defiance
## Focus 10
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Champion #PE2Healing #PE2Necromancy #PE2Positive 
**Cast** ◇ verbal; **Trigger** An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points

-----
You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing. Just before applying the attack’s damage, you recover 10d4+20 Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don’t become unconscious or dying. Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can’t use *hero’s defiance* again until you [[PE2 - Refocus|Refocus]] or the next time you prepare. *Hero’s defiance* cannot be used against effects with the death trait or that would leave no remains, such as *[[PE2 - Disintegrate|disintegrate]]*.
