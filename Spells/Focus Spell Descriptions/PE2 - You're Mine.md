**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Success** The target is stunned 1.  
**Failure** On the target’s next turn, it’s stunned 1 and you partially control it, causing it to take a single action of your choice. If it has actions left, it can act normally.  
**Critical Failure** The target is controlled for 1 round.
