Your performance protects you and your allies. Roll a [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]] check for a type you know: an auditory performance if the trigger was auditory, or a visual one for a visual trigger. You and allies in the area can use the better result between your [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]] check and the saving throw.
