# Quivering Palm
## Focus 8
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Incapacitation #PE2Monk #PE2Necromancy 
**Cast** ◆◆ somatic, verbal
**Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Duration** 1 month

-----
Make a melee unarmed Strike. If you hit and the target is alive, anytime during the duration, you can spend a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits, to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.  

**Critical Success** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.  
**Success** The target is stunned 1 and takes 40 damage, the spell ends, and the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. 
**Failure** The target is stunned 3 and takes 80 damage. The spell’s duration continues, but the target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours against being killed by *quivering palm*.
**Critical Failure** The target dies.  

If you cast *quivering palm* again, the effects of any *quivering palm* you had previously cast end.  

---
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 10 on a failure, or 5 on a success.
