When you touch the target, a symbol of the moon appears on its forehead, glowing with soft moonlight. The target glows with dim light in a 20-foot radius. It also gets a benefit based on a phase of the moon, starting with the new moon and changing to the next phase at the end of each of its turns.
- **New Moon** The target receives no benefit.  
- **Waxing Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +4 status bonus to damage rolls.  
- **Full Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, AC, and saves, and a +4 status bonus to damage.  
- **Waning Moon** The target gains a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws. After this phase, return to the new moon.
