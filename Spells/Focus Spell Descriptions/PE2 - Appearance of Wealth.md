# Appearance of Wealth
## Focus 1
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Cleric #PE2Illusion 
**Domain** wealth
**Cast** ◆◆ material, verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Area** 5-foot burst
**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

-----
You create a brief vision of immense wealth filling the spell’s area. Each creature within 20 feet of the area that could be enticed by material wealth must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that enters the area automatically disbelieves the illusion, and disbelieving the illusion ends any fascinated condition imposed by the spell. As long as you [[PE2 - Sustain a Spell ◆|Sustain the Spell]], other creatures react to the treasure like they would any other illusion, but they are not at risk of becoming fascinated.  

**Critical Success** The creature disbelieves the illusion and is unaffected by it.  
**Success** The creature is fascinated by the wealth until it has completed its first action on its next turn. 
**Failure** The creature is fascinated by the illusion.
