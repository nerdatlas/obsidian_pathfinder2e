# Weapon Surge
## Focus 1
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Cleric #PE2Evocation 
**Domain** zeal
**Cast** â—† somatic
**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 weapon you're wielding

-----
Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On your next Strike with that weapon before the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has a *striking* rune, this instead increases the number of dice from the *striking* rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).

If the target weapon leaves your possession, *weapon surge* immediately ends.
