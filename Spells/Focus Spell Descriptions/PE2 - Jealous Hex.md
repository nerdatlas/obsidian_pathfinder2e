You draw forth a hag’s innate jealousy to deny a target its greatest attribute. The target is cursed with an adverse condition depending on its highest ability modifier: [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] (enfeebled); [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]] (clumsy); [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Constitution|Constitution]] (drained); or [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Wisdom|Wisdom]], or [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Charisma|Charisma]] (stupefied). On a tie, the creature decides which of the conditions associated with the tied ability modifiers to take. The target must attempt a Will save.  

**Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Failure** The condition’s value is 1.  
**Critical Failure** The condition’s value is 2.  

At the start of each of your turns, the target can attempt another Will save, ending the effect on a success.
