Your encouragement inspires your ally to succeed at a task. This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to Aid your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you later use the Aid reaction, you can roll [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]] instead of the normal skill check, and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are legendary in [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]], you automatically critically succeed.

The GM might rule that you can’t use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check (such as a check to [[PE2 - Sneak ◆|Sneak]] quietly or maintain a disguise).
