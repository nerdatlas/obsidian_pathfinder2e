# Zeal For Battle
## Focus 4
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Cleric #PE2Emotion #PE2Enchantment #PE2Fortune #PE2Mental 
**Domain** zeal
**Cast** ‚ü≥ verbal; **Trigger** You and at least 1 ally are about to roll initiative.
**Range** 10 feet; **Targets** you and the triggering ally

-----
You stoke the righteous anger within yourself and an ally. You and the target ally each roll a d20 and use the higher result for both your initiative rolls. You each still use your own Perception modifier or other statistic to determine your results.
