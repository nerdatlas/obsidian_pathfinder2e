**Domain** creation
**Cast** ◆◆ material, somatic
**Range** 15 feet; **Targets** 1 item or work of art that fits entirely within the range
**Duration** 10 minutes

-----
You transform the target to make it match your artisanal and artistic vision. If you have expert proficiency in [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]], the item grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls if it’s a weapon or skill checks if it’s a skill tool. The target is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is obviously temporary, so its monetary value doesn’t change.

When you cast this spell, any previous *artistic flourish* you had cast ends.
