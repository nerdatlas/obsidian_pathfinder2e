# Healer's Blessing
## Focus 1
#PE2Uncommon #PE2Cleric #PE2Necromancy 
**Domain** healing
**Cast** ◆ verbal
**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 willing living creature
**Duration** 1 minute

-----
Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.

The target regains additional Hit Points from *healer’s blessing* only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.

**Heightened (+1)** The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
