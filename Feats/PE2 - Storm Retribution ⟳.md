#PE2Druid

**Prerequisites** storm order, *tempest surge* order spell
**Trigger** An opponent adjacent to you critically hits you with a melee weapon or melee unarmed attack
**Requirements** You have at least 1 available Focus Point.

You lash out, directing a burst of storming fury toward a creature that has harmed you. You cast *tempest surge* on the triggering opponent and push that creature, moving it 5 feet away from you if it fails its Reflex save, or 10 feet if it critically fails. This movement is forced movement.
