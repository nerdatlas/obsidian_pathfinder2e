## Feat 18
#PE2Cleric #PE2Concentrate #PE2Metamagic 
When you pull forth positive or negative energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy. If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action *harm* or *heal* to heal or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature adjacent to either you or the target. Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell. This spell is the same level as the 2-action *harm* or *heal* you cast and doesn't cost another spell slot.
