# Sabotage ◆
## Feat 4
#PE2Incapacitation #PE2Rogue

**Requirements** You have a free hand.

---
You subtly damage others’ equipment. Choose one item that a creature within your reach wields or carries. The item must have moving parts that you could possibly sabotage (a shortbow could be sabotaged, but a longsword could not). Attempt a Thievery check against the Reflex DC of the creature. Damage dealt by Sabotage can’t take the item below its Break Threshold. 

**Critical Success** You deal damage equal to four times your [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]] proficiency bonus.  
**Success** You deal damage equal to double your [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]] proficiency bonus.  
**Critical Failure** Temporarily immune to your Sabotage for 1 day.
