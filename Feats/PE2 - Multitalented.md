# Multitalented
## Feat 9
#PE2Human

You've learned to split your focus between multiple classes with ease. You gain a 2nd-level multiclass dedication feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype.

If you're a [[PE2 - Human Ancestry#Half-Elf|half-elf]], you don't need to meet the feat's ability score prerequisites.
