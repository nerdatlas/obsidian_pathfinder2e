# Eschew Materials
## Feat 1
#PE2Wizard
You can use clever workarounds to replicate the arcane essence of certain materials. When Casting a Spell that requires material components, you can provide these material components without a material component pouch by drawing intricate replacement sigils in the air. Unlike when providing somatic components, you still must have a hand completely free. This doesn’t remove the need for any materials listed in the spell’s cost entry.
