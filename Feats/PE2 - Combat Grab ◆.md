Your studies make you informed on every subject. You are trained in Bardic Lore, a special [[PE2 - Lore]] skill that can be used only to Recall Knowledge, but on any topic. If you have legendary proficiency in [[PE2 - Occultism]], you gain expert proficiency in Bardic Lore, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in Bardic Lore by any other means.
