# Dispelling Slice ◆◆
## Feat 16
#PE2Rogue
Your sneak attack slices through the threads binding magic to a target. Make a Strike against a flat-footed creature. If your Strike deals sneak attack damage, you attempt to counteract a single spell active on the target (your choice). Your counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC – 10.
