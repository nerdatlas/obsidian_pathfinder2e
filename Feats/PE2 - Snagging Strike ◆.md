# Snagging Strike â—†
## Feat 1
#PE2Fighter

**Requirements** You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.

---
You combine an attack with quick grappling moves. to throw an enemy off balance as long as it stays in your reach. Make a Strike while keeping one hand free. If this Strike hits, the target is flat-footed until the start of your next turn or until it's no longer within the reach of your hand, whichever comes first.
