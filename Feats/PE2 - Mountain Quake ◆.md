# Mountain Quake ◆
## Feat 14
#PE2Monk

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Mountain Stronghold ◆|Mountain Stronghold]]
**Requirements** You are in [[PE2 - Mountain Stance ◆|Mountain Stance]]

---
You stomp, shaking the earth beneath you. Creatures on the ground within a 20-foot emanation take damage equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier (minimum 0), which they can resist with a basic Fortitude save. On a failure, they also fall prone. After you use this action, you can’t use it again for 1d4 rounds.

**Special** If you have this feat, the [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier cap to your AC while using [[PE2 - Mountain Stance ◆|Mountain Stance]] increases from +1 to +2.
