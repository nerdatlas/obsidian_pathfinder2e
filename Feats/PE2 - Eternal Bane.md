**Prerequisites** evil alignment

A life of evil has made you a nexus for your deity's vile power. You're continuously surrounded by a *bane* spell with a spell level equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can't increase it. You can Dismiss the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
