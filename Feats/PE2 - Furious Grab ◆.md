# Furious Grab ◆
## Feat 12
#PE2Barbarian #PE2Rage 

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful Strike, and either you have a hand free or your Strike used a grapple weapon.

---
You grab your foe while it's distracted by your attack. The foe you hit becomes grabbed, as if you had succeeded at an [[PE2 - Athletics]] check to [[PE2 - Grapple ◆]] the foe.
