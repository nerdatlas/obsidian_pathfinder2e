# Improved Communal Healing
## Feat 4
#PE2Cleric

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Communal Healing]]

---
You can direct excess channeled energy outward to benefit an ally. You can grant the Hit Points you would regain from [[PE2 - Communal Healing]] to any one creature within the range of your *heal* spell instead of yourself. You can also use [[PE2 - Communal Healing]] when you target only yourself with a *heal* spell, though if you do, you must grant the additional healing to someone other than yourself.
