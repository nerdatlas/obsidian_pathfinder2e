# Reckless Abandon â—‡
## Feat 16
#PE2Barbarian #PE2Rage 

**Trigger** Your turn begins, and you are at half or fewer Hit Points.

---
Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw caution to the wind to finish the fight. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, a -2 penalty to AC, and a -1 penalty to saves. These bonuses and penalties last until your Rage ends or until you are above half Hit Points, whichever comes first.
