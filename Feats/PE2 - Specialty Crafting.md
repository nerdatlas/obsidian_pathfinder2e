# Specialty Crafting
## Feat 1
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]]

---
Your training focused on [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]] one particular kind of item. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [[Crafting|Crafting]] checks to [[PE2 - Craft|Craft]] items of that type. If you are a master in [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]], this bonus increases to +2. 

If itâ€™s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.
