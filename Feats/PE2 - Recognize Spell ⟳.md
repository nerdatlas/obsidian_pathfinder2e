**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Arcana|Arcana]], [[PE2 - Nature|Nature]], [[PE2 - Occultism|Occultism]], or [[PE2 - Religion|Religion]]
**Trigger** A creature within line of sight casts a spell that you don’t have prepared or in your spell repertoire, or a trap or similar object casts such a spell. You must be aware of the casting.

If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition and it’s a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can’t get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 10 if you’re legendary. The GM rolls a secret [[PE2 - Arcana|Arcana]], [[PE2 - Nature|Nature]], [[PE2 - Occultism|Occultism]], or [[PE2 - Religion|Religion]] check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure.

**Critical Success** You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.
**Success** You correctly recognize the spell.  
**Failure** You fail to recognize the spell.  
**Critical Failure** You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM’s choice.
