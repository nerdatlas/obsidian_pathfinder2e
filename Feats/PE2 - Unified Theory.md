Youâ€™ve started to make a meaningful connection about the common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through an arcane lens. Whenever you use a skill action or a skill feat that requires a [[PE2 - Nature|Nature]], [[PE2 - Occultism|Occultism]], or [[PE2 - Religion|Religion]] check, depending on the magic tradition, you can use [[PE2 - Arcana|Arcana]] instead. If you would normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using [[PE2 - Arcana|Arcana]] on other magic (such as when using Identify Magic), you no longer do so.
