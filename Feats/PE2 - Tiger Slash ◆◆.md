# Tiger Slash ◆◆
## Feat 6
#PE2Monk

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Tiger Stance ◆|Tiger Stance]]
**Requirements** You are in [[PE2 - Tiger Stance ◆|Tiger Stance]]

You make a fierce swipe with both hands. Make a tiger claw Strike. It deals two extra weapon damage dice (three extra dice if you’re 14th level or higher), and you can push the target 5 feet away as if you had successfully [[PE2 - Shove ◆|Shoved]] them. If the attack is a critical success and deals damage, add your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier to the persistent bleed damage from your tiger claw.
