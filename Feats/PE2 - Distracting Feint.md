# Distracting Feint
## Feat 2
#PE2Rogue

**Prerequisites** scoundrel racket

---
Your Feints are far more distracting than normal, drawing your foes’ attention and allowing you and your allies to take greater advantage. While a creature is flat-footed by your Feint, it also takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Perception checks and Reflex saves.
