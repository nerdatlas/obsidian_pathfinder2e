# Communal Healing
## Feat 2
#PE2Cleric #PE2Healing #PE2Positive
You're a conduit for positive energy, and as you channel it through you, it heals some of your minor injuries. When you cast the *heal* spell to heal a single creature other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell level of the *heal* spell.
