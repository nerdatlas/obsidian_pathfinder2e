# Healing Transformation â—†
## Feat 10
#PE2Druid #PE2Metamagic 
You can take advantage of shapechanging magic to close wounds and patch injuries. If your next action is to cast a non-cantrip polymorph spell that targets only one creature, your polymorph spell also restores 1d6 Hit Points per spell level to that creature. This is a healing effect.
