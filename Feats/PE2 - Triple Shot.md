# Triple Shot
## Feat 6
#PE2Fighter

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Double Shot ◆◆]]

---
You can quickly fire multiple shots with greater control. When you use [[PE2 - Double Shot ◆◆]], you can make the attacks against the same target. You can add an additional action to [[PE2 - Double Shot ◆◆]] to make three ranged Strikes instead of two. If you do, the penalty is -4. All attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made all of them.
