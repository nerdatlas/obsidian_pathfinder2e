The restorative power of your healing invigorates the recipient. If the next action you use is to cast *heal* targeting a single living creature and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also gains three bonuses until the end of its next turn: a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed, a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, and a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.
