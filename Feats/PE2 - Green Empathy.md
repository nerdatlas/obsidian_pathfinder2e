# Green Empathy
## Feat 6
#PE2Druid

**Prerequisites** leaf order

---
You can communicate with plants on a basic level and use [[PE2 - Diplomacy]] to [[PE2 - Make an Impression]] on them and to make very simple [[PE2 - Request ◆]]s of them. Non-creature plants typically can't fulfill most requests you might ask of them unless you have access to other magic such as *speak with plants*. Because of your affiliation with the leaf order, plants have a sense that you support them, so you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your check to Make a [[PE2 - Request ◆]] of a plant using Green Empathy.
