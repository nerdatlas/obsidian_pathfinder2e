# Brutish Shove ◆
## Feat 2
#PE2Fighter #PE2Press 

**Requirements** You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon

---
Throwing your weight behind your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a Strike wiht a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically [[PE2 - Shove ◆]] it, with the same benefits as the [[PE2 - Shove ◆]] action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn't trigger reactions.

This Strike has the following failure effects.

**Failure** The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn.
