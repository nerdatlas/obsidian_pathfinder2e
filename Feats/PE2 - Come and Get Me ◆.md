## Feat 10
#PE2Barbarian #PE2Concentrate #PE2Rage 
You open yourself to attacks so you can respond in turn. Until your rage ends, you are flat-footed, and damage rolls against you gain a +2 circumtance bonus. If a creature hits you, that creature is flat-footed to you until the end of your next turn. If you hit it before the end of your next turn, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Constitution|Constitution]] modifier, or double that on a critical hit. These temporary Hit Points last until the end of your rage.
