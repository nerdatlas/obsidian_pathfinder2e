# Graceful Poise ◆
## Feat 16
#PE2Fighter #PE2Stance 

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Double Slice ◆◆|Double Slice]]

---
With the right positioning, your off-hand weapon can strike like a scorpion’s stinger. While you are in this stance, if you make your second Strike from [[PE2 - Double Slice ◆◆|Double Slice]] with an agile weapon, [[PE2 - Double Slice ◆◆|Double Slice]] counts as one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
