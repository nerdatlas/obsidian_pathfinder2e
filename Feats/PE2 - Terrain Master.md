You adapt to your surroundings in any natural terrain. You can spend 1 hour practicing in your current terrain in order to make it your favored terrain, replacing your current favored terrain temporarily. If you spend a full day out of the new favored terrain, your favored terrain reverts back to your original choice when you took the [[PE2 - Favored Terrain|Favored Terrain]] feat.
