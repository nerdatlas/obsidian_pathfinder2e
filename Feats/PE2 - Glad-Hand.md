First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check to [[PE2 - Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
