**Prerequisites** bloodline that grants divine spells

---
The divine might provided by your bloodline flows through you. You gain an additional spell slot of your highest level, which you can use only to cast your choice of *heal* or *harm*. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if they arenâ€™t in your spell repertoire.
