You swiftly attack your hunted prey with both weapons. Make two Strikes against your hunted prey, one with each of the required weapons. If both hit the same hunted prey,  
combine their damage for the purpose of  
its resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to each Strike normally.
