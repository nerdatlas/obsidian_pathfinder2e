# Genius Mutagen
## Feat 16
#PE2Alchemist
Specialized tweaks to your body's chemical composition considerably broaden the benefits you gain from cognitive mutagens. When you're affected by a cognitive mutagen, you also gain the mutagen's item bonus to [[PE2 - Deception]], [[PE2 - Diplomacy]], [[PE2 - Intimidation]], [[PE2 - Medicine]], [[PE2 - Nature]], [[PE2 - Performance]], [[PE2 - Religion]], and [[PE2 - Survival]] checks. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures within 60 feet with whom you share a languange. The communication is two-way once you establish it, so a creature you contact can also communicate with you.
