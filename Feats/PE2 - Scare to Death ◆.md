**Prerequisites** legendary in [[PE2 - Intimidation|Intimidation]]

You can frighten foes so much, they might die. Attempt an [[PE2 - Intimidation|Intimidation]] check against the Will DC of a living creature within 30 feet of you that you sense or observe and who can sense or observe you. If the target can’t hear you or doesn’t understand the language you are speaking, you take a –4 circumstance penalty. The creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. 

**Critical Success** The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your [[PE2 - Intimidation|Intimidation]] DC or die. If the target succeeds at its save, it becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing for 1 round; it suffers no effect on a critical success.
**Success** The target becomes frightened 2. 
**Failure** The target becomes frightened 1. 
**Critical Failure** The target is unaffected.
