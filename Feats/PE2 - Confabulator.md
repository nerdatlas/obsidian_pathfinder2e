**Prerequisites** expert in [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]]

Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts to [[PE2 - Create A Diversion ◆|Create a Diversion]] or [[PE2 - Lie|Lie]] to it from +4 to +2. If you’re a master in [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]], reduce the bonus to +1, and if you’re legendary, your targets don’t get these bonuses at all.
