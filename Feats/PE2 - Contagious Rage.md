You can drive your allies into a frenzy, granting them incredible benefits. You can ignore the requirements on [[PE2 - Share Rage ◆]], using it multiple times in a Rage. Allies affected by [[PE2 - Share Rage ◆]] who accept your anathema for the duration of the Rage gain your instinct ability and the specialization ability it gains from weapon specialization, but not greater weapon specialization.
