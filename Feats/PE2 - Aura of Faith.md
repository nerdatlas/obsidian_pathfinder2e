## Feat 12
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** tenets of good

---
You radiate an aura of pure belief that imbues your attacks and those of nearby allies with holy power. Your Strikes deal an extra 1 good damage against evil creatures. Also, each good-aligned ally within 15 feet gains this benefit on their first Strike that hits an evil creature each round.
