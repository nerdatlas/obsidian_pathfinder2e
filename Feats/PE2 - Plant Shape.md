You can take the form of a plant creature. Add the forms listed in *plant form* to your *wild shape* list; if you don't have *wild shape*, you can instead cast *plant form* once per day, heightened to the same level as your highest-level druid spell slot. Whenever you're polymorphed into another form using *wild shape*, you gain resistance 5 to poison.
