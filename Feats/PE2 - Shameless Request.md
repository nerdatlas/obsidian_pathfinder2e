# Shameless Request
## Feat 7
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** master in [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]]

You can downplay the consequences or outrageousness of your requests using sheer brazenness and charm. When you [[PE2 - Request ◆|Request]] something, you reduce any DC increases for making an outrageous request by 2, and if you roll a critical failure for your [[PE2 - Request ◆|Request]], you get a failure instead. While this means you can never cause your target to reduce their attitude toward you by making a [[PE2 - Request ◆|Request]], they eventually tire of requests, even though they still have a positive attitude toward you.
