# Lasting Doubt
## Feat 12
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** redeemer cause

---
When you cast doubt upon your foes, the effect lasts longer than usual. After being enfeebled 2 by your Glimpe of Redemption, the foe is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. If you have [[PE2 - Weight of Guilt]], after being stupefied 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is stupefied 1 for 1 minute or until the flat check from stupefied causes it to lose a spell, whichever comes first.
