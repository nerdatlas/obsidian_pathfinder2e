# Feral Mutagen
## Feat 8
#PE2Alchemist
Your bestial mutagen brings out the beast lurking within you, granting you especially sharp claws and teeth as well as a ferocious appearance. Whenever you're affected by a bestial mutagen, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your [[PE2 - Intimidation]] checks. In addition, your claws and jaws are increasingly vicious, and they gain the deadly d10 trait. Finally, you can increase the mutagen's penalty to AC from -1 to -2 and, in exchange, increase the damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step.
