# Craft Anything
## Feat 15
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** legendary in [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]]

---
You can find ways to craft just about anything, despite restrictions. As long as you have the appropriate [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]] skill feat (such as Magical Crafting for magic items) and meet the item’s level and proficiency requirement, you ignore just about any other requirement, such as being of a specific ancestry or providing spells. The only exceptions are requirements that add to the item’s cost, including castings of spells that themselves have a cost, and requirements of special items such as the philosopher’s stone that have exclusive means of access and [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]]. The GM decides whether you can ignore a requirement.
