# Minor Magic
## Feat 2
#PE2Rogue
You’ve dabbled in minor magical abilities. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips available to that tradition. Your key spellcasting ability is [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Charisma|Charisma]], and you’re trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition of your chosen cantrips.
