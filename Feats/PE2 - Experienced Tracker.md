**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]]

Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can [[PE2 - Track|Track]] while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]] check. If you’re a master in [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]], you don’t take the –5 penalty. If you’re legendary in [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]], you no longer need to roll a new [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]] check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.
