# Improved Poison Weapon
## Feat 8
#PE2Rogue

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Poison Weapon ◆|Poison Weapon]]

---
You deliver poisons in ways that maximize their harmful effects. When you apply a simple poison with [[PE2 - Poison Weapon ◆|Poison Weapon]], the poison deals 2d4 poison damage instead of 1d4 poison damage. You don’t waste a poison you apply with [[PE2 - Poison Weapon ◆|Poison Weapon]] on a critically failed attack roll.
