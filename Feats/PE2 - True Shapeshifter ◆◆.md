#PE2Concentrate #PE2Druid

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Dragon Shape]], [[Table Top Role Playing Games/Pathfinder 2e/Feats/PE2 - Wild Shape]]

You transcend the limitations of form. While under the effects of *wild shape*, you can change into any other form on your *wild shape* list; if the durations of the forms would vary, use the shorter of the two durations.

Once per day, you can transform into a kaiju, with the effects of *nature incarnate*; if you have [[PE2 - Plant Shape]], you can instead transform into a green man.
