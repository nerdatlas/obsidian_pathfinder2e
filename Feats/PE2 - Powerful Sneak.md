# Powerful Sneak
## Feat 18
#PE2Rogue
You have learned to exploit your enemiesâ€™ lowered defenses. When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike using your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier on the attack roll and you would deal sneak attack damage, you can change the additional damage from sneak attack into ordinary damage of the same type as your Strike, rather than precision damage.
