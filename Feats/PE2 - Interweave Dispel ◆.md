# Interweave Dispel â—†
## Feat 14
#PE2Metamagic #PE2Sorcerer

**Prerequisites** *dispel magic* in your spell repertoire

---
You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects at a foe. If your next action is to cast a single-target spell against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast *dispel magic* on the foe as a free action, expending a spell slot as normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.
