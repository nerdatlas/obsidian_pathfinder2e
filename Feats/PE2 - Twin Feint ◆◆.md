# Twin Feint ◆◆
## Feat 1
#PE2Rogue

**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

---
You make a dazzling series of attacks with both weapons, using the first attack to throw your foe off guard against a second attack at a different angle. Make one Strike with each of your two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is automatically flat-footed against the second attack. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally.
