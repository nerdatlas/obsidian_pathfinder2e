**Prerequisites** expert in [[PE2 - Nature|Nature]]

You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7 days of downtime regularly interacting with a normal animal (not a companion or other special animal) that is friendly or helpful to you. After this duration, attempt a DC 20 [[PE2 - Nature|Nature]] check. If successful, you bond with the animal. The animal is permanently helpful to you, unless you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful animal is easier to direct.

Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had. You canâ€™t have both a bonded animal and an animal companion (though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).
