# Clever Counterspell
## Feat 12
#PE2Wizard

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Counterspell ⟳|Counterspell]], Quick Recognition

---
You creatively apply your prepared spells to [[PE2 - Counterspell ⟳|Counterspell]] a much wider variety of your opponents’ magic. Instead of being able to counter a foe’s spell with [[PE2 - Counterspell ⟳|Counterspell]] only if you have that same spell prepared, you can use [[PE2 - Counterspell ⟳|Counterspell]] as long as you have the spell the foe is casting in your spellbook. When you use [[PE2 - Counterspell ⟳|Counterspell]] in this way, the prepared spell you expend must share a trait other than its tradition with the triggering spell. At the GM’s discretion, you can instead use a spell that has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell). Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a –2 penalty to your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if the expended spell is especially appropriate.
