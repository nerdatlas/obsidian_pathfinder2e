You can patch up wounds, even in combat. Attempt a [[PE2 - Medicine|Medicine]] check with the same DC as for [[PE2 - Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] and restore the corresponding amount of HP; this doesn’t remove the wounded condition. As with [[PE2 - Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is then temporarily immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day.
