# Knockdown ◆◆
## Feat 4
#PE2Fighter #PE2Flourish 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Athletics]]

---
You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an [[PE2 - Athletics]] check to [[PE2 - Trip ◆]] the creature you hit. If you're wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore [[PE2 - Trip ◆]]'s requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.
