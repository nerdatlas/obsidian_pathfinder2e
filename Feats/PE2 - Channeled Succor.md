**Prerequisites** healing font

You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one *heal* spell you've prepared in your extra slots from from healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: *remove curse*, *remove disease*, *remove paralysis*, or *restoration*. The spell is heightened to the same level as the *heal* spell you sacrificed.
