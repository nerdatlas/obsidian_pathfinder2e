Ever inventive, you have discovered increasingly devastating ways for your bombs to impede and hamper your foes. When you use [[PE2 - Debilitating Bomb ◇]], add the following to the list of effects you can choose from: enfeebled 2, stupefied 2, or a -15-foot status penalty to Speeds. If you instead apply one of the effects listed in [[PE2 - Debilitating Bomb ◇]], the target avoids the effect only if the result of its saving throw is a critical success.
