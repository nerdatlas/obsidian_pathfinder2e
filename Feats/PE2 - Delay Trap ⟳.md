## Feat 8
#PE2Rogue

**Trigger** A trap within your reach is triggered

---
You can jam the workings of a trap to delay its effects. Attempt a [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]] check to [[PE2 - Disable a Device ◆◆|Disable a Device]] on the trap; the DC to do so is increased by 5, and the effects are as follows.

**Critical Success** You prevent the trap from being triggered, or you delay the activation until the start or end of your next turn (your choice).
**Success** You prevent the trap from being triggered, or you delay the activation until the end of your next turn (whichever is worse for you; GM’s choice).
**Failure** No effect. 
**Critical Failure** You’re flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
