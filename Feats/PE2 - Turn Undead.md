# Turn Undead
## Feat 2
#PE2Cleric
Undead harmed by your positive energy might flee, compelled by an innate aversion to the force opposite undeath. When you use a *heal* spell to damage undead, each undead of your level or lower that critically fails its save gains the fleeing condition for 1 round.
