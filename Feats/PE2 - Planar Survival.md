# Planar Survival
## Feat 7
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** master in [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]]

You can Subsist using [[PE2 - Survival|Survival]] on different planes, even those without resources or natural phenomena you normally need. For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks food that could normally sustain you. A success on your check to Subsist can also reduce the damage dealt by the plane, at the GMâ€™s discretion.
