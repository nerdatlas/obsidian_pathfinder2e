# Cognitive Loophole ‚ü≥
## Feat 16
#PE2Rogue

**Trigger** Your turn ends.
**Requirements** You are currently affected by a mental effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.

---
You can find a loophole in a mental effect to temporarily overcome it. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single mental effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Cognitive Loophole only once.

**Special** You can use this reaction even if the mental effect is preventing you from using reactions.
