# Superior Bond
## Feat 14
#PE2Wizard

**Prerequisites** arcane bond

When you draw upon your bonded item, you can leave a bit of energy within it for later use. You can use Drain Bonded Item one additional time per day, but only to cast a spell 2 or more levels lower than your highest-level wizard spell slot.
