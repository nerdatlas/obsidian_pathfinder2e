#PE2Ranger
You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[PE2 - Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on animals and to make very simple [[PE2 - Request â—†|Requests]] of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.
