# Imposing Destrier
## Feat 10
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** divine ally (steed), [[PE2 - Loyal Warhorse]]

Under your care, your mount has realized its innate potential. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a nimble or savage animal companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the [[PE2 - Command An Animal â—†]] action, your mount can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.
