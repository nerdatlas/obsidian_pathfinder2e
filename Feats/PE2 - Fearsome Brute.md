# Fearsome Brute
## Feat 10
#PE2Fighter
Fear makes your foes weak and more vulnerable to your attacks. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls for your Strikes against frightened creatures. The bonus is equal to double the target’s frightened value.

If you have master proficiency in [[PE2 - Intimidation|Intimidation]], increase the bonus to triple the target’s frightened value.
