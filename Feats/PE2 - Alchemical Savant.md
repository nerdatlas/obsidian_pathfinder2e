# Alchemical Savant
## Feat 1
#PE2Alchemist

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Crafting]]

---
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the [[PE2 - Crafting]] skill to [[PE2 - Identify Alchemy]] on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
