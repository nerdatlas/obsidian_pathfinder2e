# Double Shot ◆◆
## Feat 4
#PE2Fighter #PE2Flourish 

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon with reload 0.

---
You shoot twice in blindingly fast succession. Make two Strikes, each against a seperate target and with a -2 penalty. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.
