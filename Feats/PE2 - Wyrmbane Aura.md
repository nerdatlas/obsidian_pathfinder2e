## Feat 14
#PE2Champion

**Requirements** [[PE2 - Dragonslayer Oath]]

Your aura protects against destructive energies and dragons' breath. You and all allies within 15 feet gain resistance equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Charisma|Charisma]] modifier to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and poison. If the source of one of these types of damage is a dragon's breath, increase the resistance to half your level.
