# Crushing Grab
## Feat 2
#PE2Monk
Like a powerful constrictor, you crush targets in your unyielding grasp. When you successfully [[PE2 - Grapple â—†|Grapple]] a creature, you can deal bludgeoning damage to that creature equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier. You can make this attack nonlethal with no penalty.
