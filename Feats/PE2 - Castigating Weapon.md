# Castigating Weapon
## Feat 10
#PE2Cleric

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Holy Castigation]]

---
The force of your deity's castigation strengthens your body so you can strike down the wicked. After you damage a fiend using a *heal* spell, your weapon or unarmed Strikes deal extra good damage to fiends equal to half the level of the *heal* spell until the end of your next turn. This is cumulative with any good damage the weapon already deals (such as from a *holy* rune).
