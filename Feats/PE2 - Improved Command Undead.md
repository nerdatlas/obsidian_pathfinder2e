## Feat 10
#PE2Cleric

**Prerequisites** harmful font, [[PE2 - Command Undead ◆]], evil alignment

---
Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your commands. When you use [[PE2 - Command Undead ◆]], if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it is your minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it is your minion for 10 minutes. If it critcally fails, it is your minion for 24 hours.
