# Orc Sight
## Feat 1

Your orc blood is strong enough to grant you the keen vision of your orc forebears. You gain darkvision, allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness, you see in black and white only.

**Special** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
