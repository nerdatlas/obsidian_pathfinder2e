Your flexible mind can quickly shift spells. If you add a spell to your repertoire during your daily preparations using [[PE2 - Esoteric Polymath]], when you prepare again, you can choose to keep the new spell from [[PE2 - Esoteric Polymath]] in your repertoire and instead lose access to another spell of the same level in your repertoire.
