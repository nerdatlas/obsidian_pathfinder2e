# Wild Winds Initiate
## Feat 8
#PE2Monk

**Prerequisites** ki spells

---
You learn a mystical stance that lets you attack from a distance. You gain the *wild winds stance* ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. While entering the stance is a ki spell, the wind crash Strikes the stance grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
