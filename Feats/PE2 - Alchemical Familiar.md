#PE2Alchemist
You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar appears to be a small creature of flesh and blood, though it might have some unusual or distinguishing aspects depending on your creative process. Like other familiars, your alchemical familiar assists youi n your laboratory and on adventures. This familiar uses your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier to determine its Perception, [[PE2 - Acrobatics]], and [[PE2 - Stealth]] modifiers.
