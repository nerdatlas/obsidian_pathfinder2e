Even a single missile can throw off your enemy’s balance, and more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until the start of your next turn. If you critically hit your prey or hit it twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until the end of your next turn instead.
