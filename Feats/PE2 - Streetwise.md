**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Society|Society]]

You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement. You can use your [[PE2 - Society|Society]] modifier instead of your [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] modifier to [[PE2 - Gather Information|Gather Information]]. In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall Knowledge action with [[PE2 - Society|Society]] to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] to [[PE2 - Gather Information|Gather Information]]. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to [[PE2 - Gather Information|Gather Information]] normally.
