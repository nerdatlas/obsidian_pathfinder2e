# Improved Knockdown
## Feat 10
#PE2Fighter

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Knockdown ◆◆|Knockdown]]

---

You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use [[PE2 - Knockdown ◆◆|Knockdown]], instead of making a Strike followed by a Trip, you can attempt a single Strike. If you do and your Strike hits, you also apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weapon’s damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical [[PE2 - Trip ◆|Trip]].
