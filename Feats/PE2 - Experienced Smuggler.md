**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Stealth]]

You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]] check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled or 10—whichever is higher—as the result of your die roll, adding it to your [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]] modifier to determine your [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]] check result. If you’re a master in [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]], the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you’re legendary in [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]], you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your smuggling skill, you’re more likely to find more lucrative smuggling jobs when using Underworld Lore to Earn Income.
