# Paragon's Guard ◆
## Feat 12
#PE2Fighter #PE2Stance 

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.

---
 
Once you’ve had a moment to set your stance, you always have your shield ready without a thought. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your shield raised as if you’d used the Raise a Shield action, as long as you meet that action’s requirements.
