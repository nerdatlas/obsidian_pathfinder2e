# Sense Evil
## Feat 8
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** tenets of good

---
You sense evil as a queasy or foreboding feeling. When in the presence of an aura of evil that is powerful or overwhelming, you eventually detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly, and you can't pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An evil creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a [[PE2 - Deception]] check against your Perception DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its [[PE2 - Deception]] check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Evil for 1 day.
