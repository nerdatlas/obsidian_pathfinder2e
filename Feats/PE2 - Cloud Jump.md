You unparalleled athletic skill allows you to jump impossible distances. Triple the distance you [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]] (so you could jump 60 feet on a successful DC 20 check). When you [[PE2 - High Jump ◆◆|High Jump]], use the calculation for a [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]] but don’t triple the distance.

You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]] or [[PE2 - High Jump ◆◆|High Jump]]. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap.
