# Ultimate Mercy
## Feat 18
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Mercy ◆]]

---
Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death. When you use [[PE2 - Mercy ◆]], you can cast lay on hands on a creature that died since your last turn to return to life. The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes wounded 1. You can't use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was disintegrate or a death effect.
