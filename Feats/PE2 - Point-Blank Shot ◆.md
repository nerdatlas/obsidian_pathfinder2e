# Point-Blank Shot â—†
## Feat 1
#PE2Fighter #PE2Open #PE2Stance

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon.

---
You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while you are in this stance, you don't take the penalty to your attack rolls from the volley trait. When using a ranged weapon that doesn't have the volley trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon's first range increment.
