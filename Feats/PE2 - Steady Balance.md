#PE2General #PE2Skill

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]

You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions. Whenever you roll a success using the [[PE2 - Balance ◆|Balance]] action, you get a critical success instead. You’re not flat-footed while attempting to [[PE2 - Balance ◆|Balance]] on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]] check instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge.
