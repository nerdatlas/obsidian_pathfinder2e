Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert. When you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms into a thick hide. You gain a +2 item bonus to AC (+3 if you have the greater juggernaut class feature). The thickness of your hide gives you a [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier cap to your AC of +3. This item bonus to AC is cumulative with armor potency runes on your explorer's clothing, mage armor, and braces of armor.
