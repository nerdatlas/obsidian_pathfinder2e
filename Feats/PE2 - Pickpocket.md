#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]]

You can [[PE2 - Steal ◆|Steal]] or [[PE2 - Palm an Object ◆|Palm an Object]] that’s closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can’t steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you’re a master in [[PE2 - Thievery|Thievery]], you can attempt to [[PE2 - Steal ◆|Steal]] from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, [[PE2 - Steal ◆|Stealing]] requires 2 manipulate actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.
