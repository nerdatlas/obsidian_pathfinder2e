# Dancing Leaf
## Feat 2
#PE2Monk
You are as light as a leaf whirling in the breeze. When you Leap or succeed at a [[PE2 - High Jump ◆◆|High Jump]] or [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]], increase the distance you jump by 5 feet. When calculating the damage you take from falling, don’t count any distance fallen while you are adjacent to a wall.
