# Calculated Splash
## Feat 4
#PE2Alchemist
You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.
