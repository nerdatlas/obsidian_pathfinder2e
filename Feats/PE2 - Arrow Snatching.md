# Arrow Snatching
## Feat 8
#PE2Monk

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Deflect Arrow ⟳|Deflect Arrow]]

---
You pluck missiles from the air and hurl them back at their source. When you successfully deflect an attack with [[PE2 - Deflect Arrow ⟳|Deflect Arrow]], as part of that reaction, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the attacker using the projectile you deflected. This is a thrown weapon with the same range increment and effect on a hit as the triggering attack.
