# Felling Shot ◆◆
## Feat 12
#PE2Rogue
Your ranged attacks can shoot an unprepared foe right out of the air. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon or a thrown weapon against a flat-footed creature. If the Strike is a success and deals damage, the target must attempt a Reflex save against your class DC with the following effects.

**Success** The target is unaffected.  
**Failure** The target falls up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can’t fly, jump, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground until the end of your next turn.
