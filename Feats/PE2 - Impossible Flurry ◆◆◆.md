# Impossible Flurry ◆◆◆
## Feat 18
#PE2Flourish #PE2Open #PE2Ranger

**Prerequisites** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

---
You forgo precision to attack at an impossible speed. Make three melee Strikes with each of the required weapons. All of these Strikes take the maximum multiple attack penalty, as if you had already made two or more attacks this turn.
