# Legendary Negotiation ◆◆◆
## Feat 15
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** legendary in [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]]

---
You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You attempt to [[PE2 - Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] and then [[PE2 - Request ◆|Request]] your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a –5 penalty to your [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check. The GM sets the DC of the [[PE2 - Request ◆|Request]] based on the circumstances—it’s generally at least a very hard DC of the creature’s level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.
