# Irrepressible
## Feat 9
#PE2Halfling

You are easily able to ward off attempts to play on your fears and emotions. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead. If your heritage is [[PE2 - Halfling Ancestry#Gutsy Halfling|gutsy halfling]], when you roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a failure instead.
