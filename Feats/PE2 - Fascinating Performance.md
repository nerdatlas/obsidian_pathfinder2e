# Fascinating Performance
## Feat 1
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]]

---
When you [[PE2 - Perform ◆|Perform]], compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the [[PE2 - Perform ◆|Perform]] action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you’re trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

If you’re an expert in [[PE2 - Performance|Performance]], you can fascinate up to four observers; if you’re a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you’re legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.
