**Requirements** You are unarmored.

You enter the stance of a dragon and make powerful leg strikes like a lashing dragon’s tail. You can make dragon tail attacks that deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage. They are in the brawling group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While in Dragon Stance, you can ignore the first square of difficult terrain while Striding.
