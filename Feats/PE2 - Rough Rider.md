# Rough Rider
## Feat 1
#PE2Goblin

You are especially good at riding traditional goblin mounts. You gain the Ride feat, even if you don't mean the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Nature checks to use Command an Animal on a goblin dog or wolf mount. You can always select a wolf as your animal companion, even if you would usually select an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as for a champion's steed ally.
