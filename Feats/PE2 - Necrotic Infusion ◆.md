You pour negative energy into your undead subject to empower its attacks. If the next action you use is to cast *harm* to restore Hit Points to a single undead creature, the target then deals an additional 1d6 negative damage with its melee weapons and unarmed attacks until the end of its next turn.

If the *harm* spell is at least 5th level, this damage increases to 2d6, and if the *harm* spell is at least 8th level, the damage increases to 3d6.
