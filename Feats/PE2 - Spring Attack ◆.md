# Spring Attack â—†
## Feat 12
#PE2Fighter #PE2Press 

**Requirements** You are adjacent to an enemy.

---
 
Springing away from one foe, you Strike at another. Stride up to your Speed, but you must end that movement within melee reach of a different enemy. At the end of your movement, make a melee Strike against an enemy now within reach. You can use Spring Attack while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
