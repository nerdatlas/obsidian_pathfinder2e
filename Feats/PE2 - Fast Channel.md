**Prerequisites** harmful font or healing font

---
Divine power is always at your fingertips, swiftly responding to your call. When you cast *harm* or *heal* by spending 2 actions, you can get the effects of the 3-action version instead of the 2-action version.

You can do this with *harm* if you have harmful font or *heal* if you have healing font (or both if you have [[PE2 - Versatile Font]]).
