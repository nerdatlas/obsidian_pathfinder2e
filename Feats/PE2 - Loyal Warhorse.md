# Loyal Warhorse
## Feat 6
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** divine ally (steed)

---
You and your mount have grown closer, and your loyalty to each other is unbreakable. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a mature animal companion. In addition, your mount never attacks you, even if it is magically compelled to do so.
