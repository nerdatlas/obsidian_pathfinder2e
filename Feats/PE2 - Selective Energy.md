# Selective Energy
## Feat 6
#PE2Cleric
As you call down divine power, you can prevent some enemies from benefiting or some allies from being hurt. When you cast a version of *harm* or *heal* that has an area, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Charisma|Charisma]] modifier (minimum 1) that are not targeted by the spell.
