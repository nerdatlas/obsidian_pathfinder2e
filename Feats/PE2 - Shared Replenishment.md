# Shared Replenishment
## Feat 12
#PE2Cleric

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Replenishment of War]]

---
When your deity blesses your warlike acts, you can extend that favor to your allies. You can grant temporary Hit Points from [[PE2 - Replenishment of War]] to an ally within 10 feet instead of gaining them yourself. You can grant these temporary Hit Points to a different ally each time, meaning you might be able to grant them to multiple creatures in a single turn.
