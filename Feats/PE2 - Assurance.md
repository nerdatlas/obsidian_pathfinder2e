**Prerequisites** trained in at least one skill

Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks. Choose a skill youâ€™re trained in. You can forgo rolling a skill check for that skill to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different skill and gain the benefits for that skill.
