# Swift Banishment ‚ü≥
## Feat 14
#PE2Cleric

**Trigger** You critically hit a creature that is not on its home plane.
**Requirements** You have a *banishment* spell prepared.

---
The force of your blow sends your victim back to its home plane. You expend a *banishment* spell you have prepared, affecting the creature you critically hit without needing to cast the spell. The creature can attempt to resist the spell as normal.
