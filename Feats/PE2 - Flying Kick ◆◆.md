# Flying Kick ◆◆
## Feat 4
#PE2Monk
You launch yourself at a foe. Make a Leap or attempt a [[PE2 - High Jump ◆◆|High Jump]] or [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]]. At the end of the jump, if you’re adjacent to a foe, you can immediately Strike that foe with an unarmed attack, even if the foe is in midair. You fall to the ground after the Strike. If the distance you fall is no more than the height of your jump, you land upright and take no damage.
