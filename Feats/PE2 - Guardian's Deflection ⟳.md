# Guardian's Deflection ⟳
## Feat 6
#PE2Fighter

**Trigger** An ally within your melee reach is hit by an attack, you can see the attacker, and the ally gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC would turn the critical hit into a hit or the hit into a miss.
**Requirements** You are wielding a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.

You use your weapon to deflect the attack against your ally, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to their Armor Class against the triggering attack. This turns the triggering critical hit into a hit, or the triggering hit into a miss.
