# Knockback Strike ◆◆
## Feat 10
#PE2Concentrate #PE2Monk
You focus your strength into a blow powerful enough to push an enemy away from you. Make an unarmed Strike. If you hit, attempt an [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]] check to [[PE2 - Shove ◆|Shove]] the target. This attack uses the same multiple attack penalty as your Strike, and doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty.
