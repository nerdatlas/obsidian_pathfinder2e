**Prerequisites** harmful font or healing font
**Cost** Expend a *harm* or *heal* spell.

You siphon the destructive energies of positive or negative energy through a melee attack and into your foe. Make a melee Strike and add the spell's damage to the Strike's damage. This is negative damage if you expended a *harm* spell or positive damage if you expended a *heal* spell.

The spell is expended with no effect if your Strike fails or hits a creature that isn't damaged by that energy type (such as if you hit a non-undead creature with a *heal* spell).
