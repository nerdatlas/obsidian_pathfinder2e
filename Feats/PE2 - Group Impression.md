When you [[PE2 - Make an Impression|Make an Impression]], you can compare your [[PE2 - Diplomacy|Diplomacy]] check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.
