# Stonewalker
## Feat 9
#PE2Dwarf

You have a deep reverence for and connection to stone. You gain *meld into stone* as a 3rd-level divine innate spell that you can cast once per day.

If you have the [[PE2 - Stonecunning|Stonecunning]] dwarf ancestry feat, you can attempt to find unusual stonework and stonework traps that require legendary proficiency in Perception. If you have both [[PE2 - Stonecunning|Stonecunning]] and legendary proficiency in Perception, when you're not Seeking and the GM rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework, you keep the bonus from [[PE2 - Stonecunning|Stonecunning]] and don't take the -2 circumstance penalty.
