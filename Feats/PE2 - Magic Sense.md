# Magic Sense
## Feat 12
#PE2Detection #PE2Divination #PE2Sorcerer
You have a literal sixth sense for magic. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level *detect magic* spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level *detect magic* spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
