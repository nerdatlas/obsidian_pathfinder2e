You reactively switch with your decoy to foil your foe. You use [[PE2 - Perfect Distraction ◆|Perfect Distraction]], even if you were observed, as long as you end the movement of your [[PE2 - Sneak ◆|Sneak]] while concealed or in a location with cover or greater cover. Your decoy is targeted by the attack or effect instead of you. In the case of an area effect, if your [[PE2 - Sneak ◆|Sneak]] doesn’t move you out of the area, both you and the decoy are targeted by the effect.
