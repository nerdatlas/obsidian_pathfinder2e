#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Acrobatics]]

Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter. If you’re an expert in [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you’re a master in [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you’re legendary in [[PE2 - Acrobatics|Acrobatics]], you always land on your feet and don’t take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
