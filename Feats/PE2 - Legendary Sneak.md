**Prerequisites** legendary in [[PE2 - Stealth|Stealth]], Swift Sneak

You’re always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even when there’s nowhere to hide. You can [[PE2 - Hide ◆|Hide]] and [[PE2 - Sneak ◆|Sneak]] even without cover or being concealed. When you employ an exploration tactic other than Avoiding Notice, you also gain the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to.
