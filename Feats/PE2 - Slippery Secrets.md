**Prerequisites** master in [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]]

You elude and evade attempts to uncover your true nature or intentions. When a spell or magical effect tries to read your mind, detect whether you are lying, or reveal your alignment, you can attempt a [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]] check against the spell or effectâ€™s DC. If you succeed, the effect reveals nothing.
