# Command Undead â—†
## Feat 4
#PE2Cleric #PE2Concentrate #PE2Metamagic 

**Prerequisites** harmful font, evil alignment

---
You grasp the animating force within an undead creature and bend it to your will. If the next action you use is to cast *harm* targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of that *harm* spell. Instead of *harm*'s normal effects, the target becomes controlled by you if its level is equal to or lower than your level -3. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw, and the undead uses the better result.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
**Success** The target is unaffected.
**Failure** The undead creature becomes a minion under your control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.
