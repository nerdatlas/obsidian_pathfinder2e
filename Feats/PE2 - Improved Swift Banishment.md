# Improved Swift Banishment
## Feat 18
#PE2Cleric

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Swift Banishment ⟳]]

---
You easily banish creatures with your weapon. You can use [[PE2 - Swift Banishment ⟳]] as long as you have a spell slot of 5th level or higher remaining, even if you don't have banishment prepared. You must sacrifice a prepared spell of 5th level or higher, and the *banishment* effect you create is heightened to the level of that spell. Your weapon serves as the special material component of *banishment*, causing the target to take the -2 penalty to its save against any *banishment* you cast using [[PE2 - Swift Banishment ⟳]].
