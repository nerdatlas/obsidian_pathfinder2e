# Disruptive Stance ◆
## Feat 10
#PE2Fighter #PE2Stance 
The slightest distraction can provoke your wrath, and you're prepared to foil enemies' actions. As long as you are in this stance, you can use [[PE2 - Attack of Opportunity ⟳|Attack of Opportunity]] when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions. Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your Strike hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
