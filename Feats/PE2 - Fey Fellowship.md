# Fey Fellowship
## Feat 1
#PE2Gnome

Your enhanced fey connection affords you a warmer reception from creatures of the First World as well as tools to foil their tricks. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both Perception checks and saving throws against fey.

In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

**Special** If you have the Glad-Hand skill feat, you don't take the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a fey.
