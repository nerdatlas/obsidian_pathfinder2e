#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]]

---
You can use [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]] to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to [[PE2 - Lie|Lie]] to you, use your [[PE2 - Deception|Deception]] DC if it is higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn’t apply if you don’t have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
