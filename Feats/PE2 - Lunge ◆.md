# Lunge â—†
## Feat 2
#PE2Fighter

**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon.

---
Extending your body to its limits, you attack an enemy that would normally be beyond your reach. Make a Strike with a melee weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for that Strike. If the weapon has the disarm, shove, or trip trait, you can use the corresponding action instead of a Strike.
