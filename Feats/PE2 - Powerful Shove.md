# Powerful Shove
## Feat 4
#PE2Fighter

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Aggressive Block ◇]] or [[PE2 - Brutish Shove ◆]]

---
You can push larger foes around with your attack. You can use [[PE2 - Aggressive Block ◇]] or [[PE2 - Brutish Shove ◆]] against a creature up to two sizes larger than you.

When a creature you [[PE2 - Shove ◆]] has to stop moving because it would hit an object, it takes damage equal to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier (minimum 1). This happens regardless of how you [[PE2 - Shove ◆|Shoved]] the creature.
