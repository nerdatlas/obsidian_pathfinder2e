You bellow, instilling fear in your enemies. Enemies within a 15-foot emanation must succeed at a Will save against your Intimidation DC or be frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical failure). When a creature frightened by the roar begins its turn adjacent to you, it can’t reduce its frightened value below 1 on that turn. Your first attack that hits a frightened creature after you roar and before the end of your next turn gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage.

After you use Dragon Roar, you can’t use it again for 1d4 rounds. Its effects end immediately if you leave [[PE2 - Dragon Stance ◆|Dragon Stance]]. Creatures in the area of your roar are then temporarily immune for 1 minute
