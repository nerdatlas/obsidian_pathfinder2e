# Certain Strike â—†
## Feat 10
#PE2Fighter #PE2Press 
Even when you don't hit squarely, you can still score a glancing blow. Make a melee Strike. It gains the following failure effect.

**Failure** Your attack deals any damage it would have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes damage dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, in addition to weapon damage dice.)
