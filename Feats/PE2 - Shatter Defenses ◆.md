# Shatter Defenses â—†
## Feat 6
#PE2Fighter #PE2Press 

**Requirements** A frightened creature is in your melee reach.

---
Your offense exploits your enemy's fear. Make a melee Strike against a frightened creature. If you hit and deal damage, the target becomes flat-footed until its frightened condition ends. If the target was already flat-footed to you when you damaged it with this Strike, it can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until the start of your next turn.
