# Auspicious Mount
## Feat 16
#PE2Champion

**Prerequisites** divine ally (steed), [[PE2 - Imposing Destrier]]

---
Guided by your ongoing care, your steed has developed incredible intelligence and skill. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a specialized animal companion. You can select one of the usual specializations or the auspice specialization.

Auspice mounts gain the following benefits: Your companion is marked by your deity's religious symbol as a sacred creature of your deity. Its proficiency rank in [[PE2 - Religion]] increases to expert, it can speak the language associated with your deity's servitors (Celestial for champions who follow the tenets of good), and its [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Intelligence|Intelligence]] modifier increases by 2 and its [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Wisdom|Wisdom]] modifier by 1.
