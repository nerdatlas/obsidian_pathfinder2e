Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. Add the bat and bird forms in *aerial form* to your *wild shape* list. If you have [[PE2 - Insect Shape]], you also add the wasp form to your *wild shape* list. If you have [[PE2 - Ferocious Shape]], you also add the pterosaur form to your *wild shape* list. Whenever you use *wild shape* to gian a form that grants you a specific [[PE2 - Acrobatics]] modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to [[PE2 - Acrobatics]] checks.
