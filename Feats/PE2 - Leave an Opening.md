# Leave an Opening
## Feat 14
#PE2Rogue
When you hit hard enough, you leave an opening so your ally can jump in on the action. Whenever you critically hit a flat-footed opponent with a melee attack and deal damage, the target triggers an [[PE2 - Attack of Opportunity ‚ü≥|Attack of Opportunity]] reaction from one ally of your choice who has that reaction, as if the enemy had used a manipulate action.
