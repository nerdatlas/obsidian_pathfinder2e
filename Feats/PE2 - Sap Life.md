# Sap Life
## Feat 2
#PE2Cleric #PE2Healing 
You draw the life force out of your enemies to heal your own wounds. When you cast a *harm* spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell level of your *harm* spell. If you aren't a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.
