# Read Lips
## Feat 1
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** trained in [[PE2 - Society|Society]]

---
You can read lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When you’re at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lipreading, you’re fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you focus on lip movements, and you must succeed at a [[PE2 - Society|Society]] check (DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone’s lips. In either case, the language read must be one that you know.
