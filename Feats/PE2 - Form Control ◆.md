With additional care and effort, you can take on an alternate form for a longer period of time. If your next action is to cast *wild shape*, *wild shape*'s spell level is 2 lower than normal (minimum 1st level), but you can remain transformed for up to 1 hour or the listed duration (whichever is longer). You can still Dismiss the form at any time, as permitted by the spell.
