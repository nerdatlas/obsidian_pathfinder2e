The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If the next action you use is to cast *harm* or *heal* to damage one creature, the target is knocked prone if it takes any damage from the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
