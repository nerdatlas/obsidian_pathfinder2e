# Sidestep ⟳
## Feat 8
#PE2Rogue

**Trigger** The attack roll for a Strike targeting you fails or critically fails.

---
You deftly step out of the way of an attack, letting the blow continue to the creature next to you. You redirect the attack to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the reach of the triggering attack. The attacker rerolls the Strike’s attack roll against the new target.
