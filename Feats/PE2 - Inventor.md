# Inventor
## Feat 7
#PE2Downtime #PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** master in [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]]

---
You are a genius at [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]], easily able to determine how things  
are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime  
to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works  
just like the [[PE2 - Craft|Craft]] activity: you spend half the Price of the  
formula up front, attempt a [[PE2 - Crafting|Crafting]] check, and on a success  
either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for 4 longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend  
the additional time in research, design, and development, rather  
than in creating an item. Once it’s complete, you add the new  
formula you invented to your formula book.
