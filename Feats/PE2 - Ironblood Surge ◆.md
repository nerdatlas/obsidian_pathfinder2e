#PE2Monk

**Requirements** You are in [[PE2 - Ironblood Stance ◆|Ironblood Stance]]

You steel yourself, preparing to resist oncoming attacks and  
using your muscles to absorb the impact. You gain the benefits  
of your iron sweep’s parry trait (a +1 circumstance bonus to 4 AC until the start of your next turn) and your resistance from  
[[PE2 - Ironblood Stance ◆|Ironblood Stance]] increases to your [[PE2 - Ability Scores#Strength|Strength]] modifier (if it’s  
higher) for the same duration.
