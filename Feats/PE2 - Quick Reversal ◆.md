# Quick Reversal â—†
## Feat 4
#PE2Fighter #PE2Flourish #PE2Press 

**Requirements** You are flanked by at least two enemies.

---
You turn your foes' flanking against them with a quick reverse. Make a melee Strike against one of the flanking enemies and make a second Strike with the same weapon or unarmed attack against a different enemy that is flanking you. This second Strike has the same multiple attack penalty of the initial attack and doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.
