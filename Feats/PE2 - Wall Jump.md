# Wall Jump
## Feat 7
#PE2General #PE2Skill 

**Prerequisites** master in [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]]

---
You can use your momentum from a jump to propel yourself off a wall. If you’re adjacent to a wall at the end of a jump (whether performing a [[PE2 - High Jump ◆◆|High Jump]], [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]], or Leap), you don’t fall as long as your next action is another jump. Furthermore, since your previous jump gives you momentum, you can use [[PE2 - High Jump ◆◆|High Jump]] or [[PE2 - Long Jump ◆◆|Long Jump]] as a single action, but you don’t get to Stride as part of the activity.

You can use Wall Jump only once in a turn, unless you’re legendary in [[PE2 - Athletics|Athletics]], in which case you can use Wall Jump as many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.
