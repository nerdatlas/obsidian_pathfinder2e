# Mobile Shot Stance ◆
## Feat 8
#PE2Fighter #PE2Stance 
Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged Strikes don't trigger [[PE2 - Attack of Opportunity ⟳]] or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.

If you have [[PE2 - Attack of Opportunity ⟳]], you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
