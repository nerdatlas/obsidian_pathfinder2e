Your deity's symbol protects against offensive magic. When you [[PE2 - Emblazon Armament|Emblazon an Armament]], you can choose from the following effects instead of the effects listed in that feat. These effects have the same restrictions as the base options.

- **Shield** When the wielder has the shield raised, they gain the shield's circumstance bonus to saving throws against magic, and they can use Shield Block against damage from their enemies spells.
- **Weapon** When the weapon's wielder critically hits with the weapon, they can attempt to counteract a spell on their target, using alf their level, rounded up, as the counteract level. If they attempt to do so, the emblazoned symbol immediately disapears.
