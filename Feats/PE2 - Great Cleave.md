# Great Cleave
## Feat 10
#PE2Barbarian #PE2Rage 

**Prerequisites** [[PE2 - Cleave ⟳]]

---
Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When you [[PE2 - Cleave ⟳]], if your Strike also kills or knocks the target unconscious, you can continue to make melee Strikes until you make a Strike that doesn't kill or knock a creature unconscious, or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.
