# Shake It Off â—†
## Feat 2
#PE2Barbarian #PE2Concentrate #PE2Rage 
You concentrate on your rage, overcoming fear and fighting back sickness. Reduce your frightened condition value by 1, and attempt a Fortitude save to recover from the sickened condition as if you had spent an action retching; you reduce your sicked condition value by 1 on a failure (but not on a critical failure), by 2 on a success, or by 3 on a critical success.
