## Feat 12
#PE2Monk #PE2Negative
Make an unarmed Strike. If it deals damage to a living creature, you block that creature’s inner life force. The creature takes 2d6 persistent negative damage and is enfeebled 1 until the persistent damage ends. If you’re 18th level or higher, this deals 3d6 persistent negative damage instead.
