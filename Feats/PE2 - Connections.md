You have social connections you can leverage to trade favors or meet important people. When you’re in an area with connections (typically a settlement where you’ve spent downtime building connections, or possibly another area in the same nation), you can attempt a [[PE2 - Society|Society]] check to arrange a meeting with an important political figure or ask for a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact’s choice. The GM decides the DC based on the difficulty of the favor and the figure’s prominence.
